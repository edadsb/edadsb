00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:35,618
所有的传说都来自真实故事
All legends are born in truth.

3
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:37,912
亚马逊河上流传着一个传说
From the Amazon

4
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:40,415
关于"月亮之泪"的一种花
came the legend of the Tears of the Moon.

5
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,252
据说一片花瓣
A single petal from the great Tree

6
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:47,547
可以根治百疾，可以打破所有诅咒
could cure any illness and break any curse.

7
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,760
几个世纪以来
Over the centuries,

8
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,762
无数个探险队深入密林
many expeditions went searching

9
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:56,056
寻找能够开出月亮之泪的治愈神树
for the Healing Tears of legend.

10
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,893
其中最著名的
None more famous

11
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:03,021
是来自西班牙的征服者-唐·洛佩德·阿吉雷
than that of the conquistador, Don Lope de Aguirre,

12
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:08,359
他发誓要将这种力量据为己有
who was determined to possess the Tears' power.

13
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,404
但是大自然不允许他这么做
But the jungle protected the Tears.

14
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:18,620
历史或许会告诉你，他的探险以失败告终
History will tell you, his journey ended in failure.

15
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,748
但是传说并没有在这里结束
But legend tells more.

16
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,293
神树守护族人发现了他
That he was found by the Guardians of the Tree

17
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:26,753
将他从死亡边缘救了回来
and nursed back to life.

18
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,798
但他开始向族人索要"圣镞"
That he demanded they give him the sacred Arrowhead,

19
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:32,592
一个找到月亮之泪的关键
the key to finding the Tears of the Moon.

20
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,179
当阿吉雷的露出獠牙时
That Aguirre attacked.

21
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:40,100
丛林俘虏了他们
But the jungle defended,

22
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,644
阿吉雷和他的爪牙被拖入密林深处
and Aguirre and his conquistadors were taken,

23
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,980
永世不得踏出诅咒之河
cursed, never to leave sight of the river again,

24
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:48,483
永世不得超生
unable to leave or die...

25
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,777
至少传说是这样说的
...or so the legend goes.

26
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,113
"我们知道队伍消失于"
"We know they disappeared here,

27
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,115
"哭泣水晶"
"in the region of Lagrimas de Cristal,

28
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:59,786
"我们将在这里探求到传说的真相"
"and it is here that we will find the true source of the legend,

29
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:03,456
"一棵具有无与伦比的治疗能力的神树"
"a tree that possesses unparalleled healing powers.

30
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,083
"我尊敬的同事们..."
"My esteemed colleagues..."

31
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,127
"我向你们保证"
"...I assert that the famous legend

32
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,629
"月亮之泪不是神话"
"of the Tears of the Moon is not a myth

33
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,840
"而是有科学根据的事实"  -而是有科学根据的事实
"but scientific truth."  -...but scientific truth.

34
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:14,968
"这将在现代医学界掀起革命"
"One that could revolutionizemodern medicine,

35
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,512
"在城市和战场上"
"curing illnesses that not only scourge our cities,

36
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:21,683
"治疗无数能够夺人性命的恶疾"
"but cut down more of our soldiers in the trenches than German bullets.

37
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,854
"我此行目的是希望获得贵协会的封存文物的许可"
"I have come here today to request access to your exclusive archives..."

38
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:28,773
-"包括那个古老的圣镞"
-"...including an ancient Arrowhead

39
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,944
"据传已经被瀑布探险队寻获"
"recently recovered from
the lost expedition of Dr. Albert Falls.

40
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:35,071
"圣镞也许就是那"
"The Arrowhead represents
the missing piece

41
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,157
"解开月亮之泪位置的"

42
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,784
"这里停顿一下，比较有戏剧效果"

"最后一块拼图"
"The Tears of the Moon."

44
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:46,040
我想你表达得很清楚了，霍顿先生
And you made your request, Mr. Houghton,

45
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,960
我们的回覆是，戏剧性的强调一下
and the answer remains, emphatically,

00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,296
"没门儿"  -同意 同意

not inspired amateurs.  -MEN: Hear, hear.

49
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:03,391
话虽如此，既然我已经站在台上了
Be that as it may, since I have your attention,

50
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,811

00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:12,525
"月亮之泪 "对医学很重要?
the Tears of the Moon could be to medicine?

53
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,369
你好 -哈啰

55
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,790
他利用简单的改造

56
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,918
便压制了所有敌人...
he came to dominate all his enemies from the...

57
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,545
不仅如此，还有包围战术
There was that, but also the encirclement tactic.

58
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,215
你不该出现在这里
You are not where you ought to be.

59
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,217
哦 对..我想我...

60
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,511
秘书台往那边走

00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:51,231
白喉、登革热

黄热病、花粉热， 热 热...

各种热，恩 都能因此康复

67
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,662
不好意思
Excuse me.

68
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,163

72
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,671
不过坦白说，我不知道你到底是怎么进...
Well, to be quite frank, I've no idea how you even...

73
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,935
霍顿先生，我们允许你来
Mr. Houghton, we granted you an audience

74
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,646
是看在你已故父亲的面子上
in deference to your late father.

75
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:35,441
但是我得说，这听起来很像是某位女士写的论文
This, however, seems remarkably like a paper

76
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:41,781
我有幸亲自退稿
I had the honor of refusing when it was submitted by a female writer,

莉莉.霍顿博士
a Dr. Lily Houghton.

78
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:49,372
应该无关 对吧?
No relation, I take it?

79
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,332
当然没有
None that I've ever agreed to.

80
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:54,210
要我送你出去吗?

非常感谢你的慷慨捐献

84
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,249
特别是这些纯金条
in solid gold bars, I might add.

85
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:19,921
如果每个人都这样付钱该有多好
Would make life so much simpler if more people paid in gold.

86
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:23,174
我只想要箱子里的一件东西
I don't want the whole lot, just one thing.

87
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,513
看来有人先我们一步
Seems someone got to it before me.

88
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,891
呃，应该没有，我确定所有东西都在里面。
Um, they shouldn't have. I'm sure it's all there.

89
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,476
一定是滑出来掉在某处..
It must have just slid somewhere.

90
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,353
我 我找一下

祝您有美好的一天
Good day, sir!

101
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,832
你以为你是第一个赶走我的人吗？
You think you're the first to eject me?

102
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:40,209
比那些拒绝过我欧洲俱乐部差多了！
I have been turned out of some of the best clubs in Europe!

103
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:51,929
天啊！

104
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,351
弗莱恩，把盒子给我，我会帮你起来
Fraulein, give me that box and I will help you up.

105
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,606
停下！停下！  -你快抓不住了
-Stop! Stop!  -You are slipping!

106
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,988

同胞们准备出发了吗?

111
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:35,681

我们可以退还您的钱...

钱留着，但是你要告诉我

121
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:13,302
那女人是谁

126
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,192
我该担心你吗？
Should I be concerned about you?

127
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,694
你怎么这么说，麦桂格？
Why would you say that, MacGregor?

128

那可是能拯救无数生命，改变世界的花瓣
This is a petal that could heal all, save countless lives, change the world.

I'd visit our relatives in Scotland.

不用担心 我就单枪匹马去亚马逊雨林
Don't worry about me. All alone, in the Amazon.

138

But who'd look after you?

139
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,928
恩 不知道
Well, I have no idea.

140
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,639
拜托 振作一下
Come on, cheer up.

141
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,391
坐轮船到巴西，换铁路到波尔多维洛...
Steamer to Brazil, rail to Porto Velho...

142
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,893
我们会在那里找到船长
...then all we need is a skipper.

143
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,124
首先，恭喜各位
First of all, let me congratulate you

144
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,876
选择了一位非常优秀的船长
on your excellent choice of skipper.

145
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,545
在所有能进入雨林的船当中
Of all the jungle cruises you could take in the Amazon,

146
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,339
本船无疑是
this one is undoubtedly

147
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:32,506
最便宜的
the cheapest.

148
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,175
也是最刺激的
But also the most thrilling.

149
00:10:35,383 --> 00:10:36,927
你还在导览吗？
Are you still giving a tour?

150
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,179
有阿 我正在解说
Yes, I am.

151
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,222
可以退费吗?  -不可以
Perhaps a refund? -No refunds.

152
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,183
亲爱的 早告诉你 搭别艘渡轮
We should've taken the other cruise, honey. Told you.

153
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,032
船长!
Skipper!

154
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:00,785
船长?
Skipper?

155
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,997
船长! 你需要看看这个!
Skipper! I think you should see this!

156
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,212
小心 要通过了
Heads up! Coming through!

157
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,428
我们到哪了？  -到鬼门关前了
Where were we? -About to die.

158
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,513
啊
Ah.

159
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,057
船长!
Skipper!

160
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,477
先生?
Sir?

161
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,646
这钮扣怎么一直卡住
Sometimes these buttons get stuck.

162
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,273
船长!
Skipper!

163
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:32,858
好了
All right.

164
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:48,457
各位往左看，有一些顽皮的大嘴鸟
If you look to the left of the boat, you'll see some very playful toucans.

165
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:50,626
正在玩它们最爱的"大嘴摔角"游戏
They're playing their favorite game of beak-wrestling.

166
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,002
这游戏的缺点是
The only drawback is,

167
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,588
只有二嘴鸟能玩
only two can play.

168
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,844
有二只鸟 二只都是大嘴鸟
There's two birds, and those are toucans.

169
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,304
我意思是只有"二只"大嘴鸟能玩
I'm saying that only "two can" play.

170
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,473
一二三四的二，是"二只" "大嘴"鸟能玩
Not one, but "two can" play.

171
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,100
哇
Wow.

172
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,185
现在你们眼前的石头叫做砂岩
The rocks you see here in the river are sandstone.

173
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,689
有些人也叫它花岗岩
But some people just take them for granite.

174
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,234
这是我的私藏"巨石"景点之一
It's one of my boulder attractions.

175
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,613
各位可知 我曾经在一家果汁厂当过罐头工
You know, before this, I used to work in an orange juice factory,

176
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:20,906
直到我拿了个罐头 (直到有次喝醉)
but I got canned.

177
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,992
噢... -却榨不出来  (没法集中注意力)
Oh...  -Couldn't concentrate.

178
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,285
噢...
Oh...

179
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,619
然后他们就把给一起我榨了
Yeah, they put the squeeze on me, too.

180
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:29,165
这笑话真赞，我应该用这开场的
That's a good one. I should've opened with that one.

181
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,751
各位可知，那只大蟒蛇据说
You know, they say the boa constrictor right there is capable

182
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,253
每顿饭能吃掉200多公斤
of eating up to 500 pounds per sitting.

183
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,590
我个人认为，我没办法
Personally, I find that very hard...

184
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,883
一次吃掉200多公斤
to swallow.

185
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,092
妈咪，你能不能让叔叔安静？
Mommy, can you please make him stop?

186
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,511
不可以! 插嘴不乖
No one can. And don't interrupt me like that again.

187
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,763
小心我把你抓去给大蟒蟒当晚餐
I will feed you to the boa.

188
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:44,972
她只是个孩子
She is a small child.

189
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,223
它最爱吃小孩子
He loves small children.

190
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,767
嘴巴闭起来
Close your mouth.

191
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:54,690
嘿 嘿
Hey! Hey!

192
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,234
不要乱碰  雨林可是危机四伏
Hands in the boat! Know this about the jungle,

193
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,695
举凡所见之物都会要你的命
everything that you see wants to kill you.

194
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,072
轻而易举
And can.

195
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,912
有超毒"天使号角"(曼陀罗)
Poison angel's trumpet.

196
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,914
马钱子 箭毒 香蕉蜘蛛
Strychnos. Curare. Banana spider.

197
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,962
埋葬那些死于食肉猛兽、疾病，再也找不到青春之泉的人
Marauders, dead of fever, for never finding the Fountain of Youth.

198
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:21,175
埋葬着寻找黄金之城的探险家 死于被黄貂鱼蜇伤
Adventurers, stung by stingrays, searching for cities of gold.

199
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:24,970
埋葬着因为残害当地土著而被诅咒的入侵者
Conquistadors, cursed, for slaughtering innocent natives.

200
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,182
那里有个才刚被
And then there's the ones that just got eaten

201
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,017
史前夺命河马吃掉的
by the deadly hippopotamus.

202
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,894
但河马不是这里的原生...
But hippos aren't native to the...

203
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,020
嘘!
Shh.

204
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,064
看!
Look out!

205
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:44,573
准备迎接我最爱的部分，丛林的鬼斧神工之作
This is the highlight of the tour. It's my favorite part of the jungle.

206
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,412
女士先生们，准备好了吗
Ladies and gentlemen, get ready

207
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,373
世界第八大奇迹
for the eighth Wonder of the World.

208
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,918
看好...
Wait for it...

209
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,465
水之屁股！
The backside of water!

210
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,886
看起来跟水的前面一样啊
It looks just like the front side.

211
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,971
完全不一样啊
It's completely different.

212
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,639
世界第八大奇迹，水之屁股
It's the eighth Wonder of the World, the backside of water.

213
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,225
朋友们，拿出你的相机 拜托 你不想错过这个的
Guys, get your cameras out, come on. You don't wanna miss this.

214
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,977
喀擦 喀擦 喀擦
Snap, snap, snap.

215
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,478
别停
Keep snapping.

216
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:19,024
希望那不是普卡米丘纳，南半球最血腥的蛮族
I hope those aren't the Puka Michuna, the deadliest hunters in the hemisphere.

217
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,276
他们吃人
They hunt humans!

218
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,032
别这样
Come on.

219
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,786
可以开快点吗
Please, go faster.

220
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:34,748
哦，太快引擎会坏，我买不起新的
Oh, any faster would damage my engine, and I can't afford a new one.

221
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:37,877
感谢
Grazie.

222
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,961
免客气
Prego.

223
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,922
来，听好，你们都付过钱了
All right, listen up, I get paid by the number of people I take out,

224
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,758
死了与我无关 所以抓紧了
not by the number of people I bring back. Hold on!

225
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,972
啊你，呃，顾好行李
Ah. Be a good chap and, uh, take care of the luggage.

226
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,147
说过别穿长裤
Told you not to wear trousers.

227
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,608
徒增路人注意
Drawing unnecessary attention.

228
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,151
我才不在乎
I don't care in the slightest.

229
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,365
哈啰
Hello.

230
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,543
大家 你们今天表现得很棒
Well, folks, you were all outstanding today,

231
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,338
现在请离开，回去码头
now I need you all out, standing on the dock.

232
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:07,049
意思是"滚下船"，认真的
That means "get off my boat."  I'm only serious.

233
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,133
叔叔再见
Au revoir.

234
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,218
女士 别忘了
Ma'am, don't forget

235
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,386
行李  -谢谢
to collect your baggage. -Thank you.

236
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,804
骗你的 它在后面
I'm only kidding. He's behind you.

237
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,431
再见
Adios.

238
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,225
记得照顾一下札克，他是个好孩子
Make sure you take care of Zaqueu, he's a good kid.

239
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:19,144
看起来只有10岁 其实47岁了 谢谢
He looks 10, but he's secretly 47. Thank you, sir.

240
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:23,232
哇 好迷人，这些是你做的吗?
Look, how stunning. Did you make these?

241
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,817
太美了
Beautiful.

242
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,988
哦，这很不优，不好意思，我觉得你...
Oh, that is awful. Excuse me, I just think that you...

243
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,656
就...别和猴商大小声了
Let's not start a fight with a monkey vendor.

244
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:33,200
不是我想吵架，是猴子不该被关在笼子里
I'm not going to start a fight. They clearly shouldn't be in cages.

245
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,494
喔买尬，看!是我们的船，那里!那里!
Oh, my gosh! Look, there's the boats! Look, look, look!

246
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:41,000
我觉得我们该帮自己订个好房间，吃一餐好的
Right. I think we've earned ourselves some nice lunch at the hotel,

247
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,626
泡个热水澡同时小酌一番
then a bath and a cocktail.

248
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,129
我们跨越大半个地球不是为了泡澡和小酌
We did not travel half the globe for baths and cocktails.

249
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:48,173
得找到尼罗先生才能确保行程顺利 快来
We must find this Mr. Nilo and secure our travel. Come on!

250
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,136
法兰克欠我钱
Frank owes me money.

251
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,723
早安啊 法兰小弟
Buongiorno, Frankie boy!

252
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,224
别这样叫
Please don't call me that.

253
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,309
嘿 法兰小弟 知道今天什么日子?
Hey, Frankie, you know what today is?

254
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,436
法兰克还钱日
Frank owes me money.

255
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,479
今天是本月的第三个星期二
It's the third Tuesday of the month.

256
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,565
还钱 法兰克 钱
My money, Frank. My contante.

257
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,649
在哪
Where is it?

258
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,484
哦，你是说这些钱? 都在这儿了
Oh, you mean this money? It's all here.

259
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,070
我这星期的饭钱只需要一点点
I just need this, so I can finally eat this week.

260
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,947
剩下的全都给你
The rest e per te.

261
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,910
别看不起我 法兰克 我的钱不只这些
You insult me, Frank. This is not all of my money.

262
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,747
连我的脚趾缝都不够填
This is like a little pinky toe, nothing...

263
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,416
我的小脚趾拇指头都不够塞 法兰克
Itty-bitty, little nothing of my money, Frank.

264
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,627
借了我的钱买新引擎
You borrow money from me to get a new engine,

265
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:28,297
就该连本带利还来
well, you got to pay me back, plus interest.

266
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,924
是的 我要扣押你的引擎了
Yeah, I'm going to keep your engine for now.

267
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,802
一周内还我5000元，你就能赎回去
I get 5,000 real in one week, then you get it back.

268
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:38,557
一星期内不给钱，我就没收你整条船
I don't get my money in one week, then I keep your whole boat.

269
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,892
你要我船干啥
What do you want my boat for?

270
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,727
你有一堆好船了啊
You have nice boats. You have all the boats.

271
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,646
还没 法兰克 但我打赌
Not yet, I don't, Frank. But I bet you I will.

272
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,940
你下星期一定会还钱
I'm gonna guess, by next week.

273
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,776
后会有期 法兰小弟
Arrivederci, Franco.

274
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,873
呃 这什么鬼地方
Ugh, what fresh hell is this?

275
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,333
喔 我爱上这里了
Oh, I love it!

276
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,377
不好意思
Excuse me, um,

277
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,629
请问您知道尼罗先生
do you know Mr. Nilo...

278
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,758
真优雅
Classy clientele.

279
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,302
到家了 罗西塔
Home again, Rosita.

280
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:18,430
亲亲
Mmm.

281
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,423
嘿
Hey!

282
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,176
也许得去别处找尼罗先生了
Perhaps I should search for Mr. Nilo elsewhere.

283
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,886
听说永远能在旅馆吧台找到他
There's always a chance he's at the hotel bar.

284
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,097
好吧 动作快点，不然我自己先走
Fine. But be quick about it or I'll leave without you.

285
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,016
哦，这个选项越来越可行了
Oh, that option is becoming increasingly desirable.

286
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:04,643
不好意思
Excuse me.

287
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,770
恩，请问尼罗先生的办公室?
Um, Mr. Nilo's office?

288
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,857
楼上  -谢谢，谢谢(葡萄牙文)
Upstairs. Thank you. Obri... Obrigada.

289
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,739
最近怎么样啊
How you doing?

290
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,712
尼罗先生? 您好?
Mr. Nilo? Hello?

291
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,046
法兰克欠债
Frank owes me money.

292
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:36,967
啊，你在呢，我正想和你谈笔生意
Ah, there you are. I was hoping we might have a small business chat.

293
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,510
现在没空
Not a good chat time right now.

294
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,221
但如果你明早再来
But if you came back first thing tomorrow morning,

295
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,389
我很有空
lots of available chat then.

296
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,016
不 我想要现在
No, I would much prefer now.

297
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,934
我是莉莉霍顿博士
My name is Dr. Lily Houghton,

298
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,936
我跟我弟打算渡河
and my brother and are looking for passage upriver,

299
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,521
有人说你是唯一能安全渡河的男人
and I'm told that you are the man for the job.

300
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:52,316
你被唬烂了  -不可能 你..
You were told wrong. -That's impossible, because you come...

301
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:53,859
...明明榜上有名
...highly recommended.

302
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,694
我有个想法: 你走开
I have an idea. Please go away.

303
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:59,072
尼罗先生，外面的船上到处都是你的名字
Mr. Nilo, your name is plastered all over the boats outside.

304
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,909
我觉得你在无理取闹
I think you're being a bit unreasonable.

305
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,952
明明是你在撬我的门
You're the one trying to break down my door.

306
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:08,790
我钱很多
I have a lot of money.

307
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,083
噢
Oh.

308
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,882
你衣着真特别  -有人这么说过了
You're insistent. -It's been said.

309
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:24,556
我们要逆河而上，朝着秘鲁安第斯山脉的方向
Now, we're headed upriver, in the direction of the Peruvian Andes.

310
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:28,060
这地区不会出现在一般地图上
This region doesn't really have a name on the conventional map,

311
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,938
但有些人知道
but it was once known to some

312
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:33,023
这个区域叫做"哭泣水晶"
as Lagrimas de Cristal.

313
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,359
你穿着裤子耶
You're wearing pants.

314
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,654
长裤，是的，跟你一样
Trousers. And yes, as are you.

315
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,197
英国的女人现在都这么潮吗
Do women in England do that now?

316
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,032
这个嘛 我们现在好像不在英国吧
Well, we're not in England, last time I checked.

317
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:44,660
看，跟裤子一样令人震惊的是...
Now, look, as shocking as the pants are, I'd really...

318
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,036
法兰克 把我的钱给我
ROSITA: Frank owes me money.

319
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,412
法兰克 把我的钱给我
Frank owes me money.

320
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,540
法兰克欠钱不还
Frank owes me money.

321
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,167
请你一杯?   -法兰克是谁?
Can I get you a drink? -Who's Frank?

322
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,461
谁知道  -我想喝一点东西
I have no idea.  -I will have a little something.

323
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,630
雪碧?     -你想的到的我都有
Spritzer, I assume?  -I'll have whatever you're having.

324
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,340
那 尼罗先生，你熟悉那个地区吗?
So, do you know the region, Mr. Nilo?

325
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,467
这个嘛 亚马逊河就像我的家
Well, if it's on the Amazon River, I know it.

326
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,551
只是小姐，我得告诉你
And, lady, I could tell you,

327
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,970
地球上什么地方都能去
of all the places in the world you can go,

328
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:06,598
就这个"哭泣水晶"不能去
the last place you wanna go is Lagrimas de Cristal.

329
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,350
喔 但我要 我也会去
Oh, but I do. And I will.

330
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,602
不 你不能，长裤
Oh, but you won't, Pants.

331
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,479
你到不了 没人到的了
You can't get there. Nobody can get there.

332
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:15,107
即使可以 也没人想，这不是度假
And if they could, they wouldn't. It's not a fun vacation.

333
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,109
我不是来度假的
Well, I'm not here for a vacation.

334
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,450
你从哪里拿到这张地图的?
Where'd you get the map?

335
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:29,329
很了不起对吧? 多仔细的标记
Isn't it extraordinary? The detail and the care he took.

336
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,373
出自阿吉雷的制图师之手
It was drawn by Aguirre's cartographer.

337
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,333
后来传到我父亲手上，他在我小时候
And it belonged to my father, who used to tell me

338
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:36,336
告诉了我月亮之泪的传说
all about the Tears of the Moon when I was a little girl.

339
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:40,382
所以...这就是你的动机? 你爸的床边故事?
So, that's why you wanna go? Your daddy's bedtime stories?

340
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,925
听着 你到底能不能带我们去那?
Look, can you get us there or not?

341
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,052
还是我浪费了一堆时间跟你拐弯抹角?
Or has this just been a colossal waste of my time?

342
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,220
我可以带你去
I could get you there,

343
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,389
但你得小心登革热
but you have to consider the dengue fever,

344
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,557
史前巨蟒 还有
anaconda, plus,

345
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,892
还有 危险的普卡米丘纳人
look, lady, that's the home of the actual Puka Michuna.

346
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,770
他们生吃人 再挖出你的眼珠子串成项链
They're the ones that like to eat you and wear your eyes for beads.

347
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,773
听着，女士，我得实话实说，还是做一些安全的事情吧
Look, lady, I gotta be honest with you, let's do something that's safe.

348
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,483
我 你 和你的裤子
So, me, you, and your pants,

349
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,444
可以游览小镇，很有趣的
we can go for a ride around town. That'd be fun.

350
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,904
带你去看瀑布 你感觉就很喜欢瀑布
I'll show you some waterfalls. You look like you like waterfalls.

351
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,156
还可以带你去看
And I'll also show you

352
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,199
刚刚发现的侏儒象群
the herd of pygmy elephants we just found.

353
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,534
我们去看大象吧
Let's go see some elephants.

354
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,332
我的钥匙丢了     -你搞丢了?
I lost my key for that thing. -Did you?

355
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:14,833
掉河里了
I did.

356
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,211
那看来是行不通的
Well, that's never gonna do it.

357
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,005
你会伤到自己 那很尖喔
You're gonna hurt yourself. Those are very sharp.

358
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,549
尼罗先生，我和德里的扒手
Mr. Nilo, I spent my childhood playtime

359
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:25,302
一起长大的，所以...
with the toddler pickpockets of Delhi, so...

360
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,511
有了
There we go.

361
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,222
不介意的话，我会顾好自身安全
Allow me to manage my own safety, if that's all right.

362
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,766
现在可以谈价钱了吗?
Now, shall we negotiate a price?

363
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,477
还是我另寻他船?
Or shall I just cast about for another skipper?

364
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,317
谁要买单?
Who's paying for all this?

365
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,110
哦，尼罗先生请客
Oh, Mr. Nilo insisted it was his treat.

366
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,320
没错
That's right.

367
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,906
我顶多出5,000
I consider 5,000 real more than adequate.

368
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,825
10,000，亲自带你去，我可是最棒的船长
10,000, I take you there myself. I am my best captain.

369
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:51,203
你最谦虚 我懂
Oh, and your most modest. Fine, 10,000.

370
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,746
10,000 带你活着过去
10,000 to bring you there alive.

371
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:55,123
另外 15,000 帮你把尸体带回家
If I have to bring you back dead, it's 15,000.

372
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,625
为什么我死了更贵?
Why should I pay more dead?

373
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,711
我要背你啊小姐 尸体不会自己走路
Dead, I'd have to carry you. Dead's a lot harder, lady.

374
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,005
来回 20,000 不论死活
20, dead or alive.

375
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,590
成交 但是要全额现金
Okay, but I get paid in full

376
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:06,009
在到达目的地前折返的时后付款
when we turn back before Lagrimas de Cristal.

377
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,552
为什么要折返
Why ever would we be turning back?

378
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,639
你一看到激流就会跪着求我回头
Well, you're gonna beg me to turn back, first sign of the rapids.

379
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,808
来啊 我很期待
Well, I look forward to disappointing you.

380
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:15,310
莉莉 看我找到了谁
Lily, look who I found at the hotel bar.

381
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,395
啊 尼罗船长!
Ah! Mr. Nilo.

382
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,313
早安 女士
Buongiorno, signorina.

383
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,899
他很会讨价还价，可惜遇到我
He drives a hard bargain, but he met his match with me.

384
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,360
我们五万成交
Negotiated him down to 50,000.

385
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,195
这位朋友是谁?
Who's your friend?

386
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:27,864
非尼罗
Not Mr. Nilo.

387
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,741
非尼罗  非尼罗
Not Mr. Nilo, no. -No.

388
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,077
那你应该是...?
So, I suppose that would make you...

389
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,537
好好享用 法兰克
Enjoying your meal, Frank?

390
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:35,622
是那个"欠钱不还"的法兰克?
As in, "Frank owes me money," Frank?

391
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:39,292
原来如此 都合理了
Of course. It's all making perfect sense.

392
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:42,462
我要是真信你 那可真是冤大头了
I suppose it's only a scam if you fall for it.

393
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:45,674
谢啰，法兰克先生，永远不见
Well, thank you, Mr. Frank. I hope we never meet again.

394
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,008
 嗨 尼罗先生
Mr. Nilo, hello.

395
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,388
你刚吹我口哨?    -一万二
Did you just whistle at me? -12,000.

396
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:52,472
呃，对不起
Eh, scusa.

397
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,558
10,000   -你不是搞丢了钥匙?
10,000. -Aren't you missing an engine?

398
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:57,227
女士，他连外面的茅坑都没法带你过去
Signorina, he could not get you as far as the outhouse.

399
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,438
其实 他的船就像个茅坑
In fact, his boat kind of looks like an outhouse.

400
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,815
拉奎娜号是港口最快的船，有最干净的厕所
You're never gonna find a faster boat in the harbor than La Quila.

401
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:04,276
有如刚出浴的凤凰
Plus, she has the finest bath in all Brazil.

402
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:05,861
为何要相信你?
Why should I trust you?

403
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,904
因为我是唯一能带你安全到达的男人
I'm the only one that could get you there.

404
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,584
喔买尬
Oh, my gosh!

405
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,755
小心 它们能闻到恐惧气味
Careful. They can smell fear.

406
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:27,048
我没在怕
I am not afraid.

407
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:30,302
我怕，我裤子一阵温热
Might be me. Warm, liquid fear.

408
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,274
Shoo.

409
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,943


410
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,613
大家都冷静下来
Everybody stay calm!

411
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,914
又漏了一点出来  -闭嘴
A little bit more fear just came out.  -Shut up!

412
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:13,845
痛..
Ouch.

413
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:39,204

He did it!

414
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,376
谢谢大家
Thank you, thank you. Thank you.

415

417
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:57,055
我不管你个人的事
You are a lot of things that I don't really care for.

418
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:00,225
只是你勉强可以胜任，所以...
But you are capable, so,

419
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,476
12,000.

420
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,602
-15,000.
-12,000.

421
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,646
-15...
-Nuh!

422
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:08,191
12,000. 一半现付，一半活着回来再付
12. Half now, half upon return, alive,

423
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,027
如果你说好，我就在码头等你
and if we have a deal, I'll meet you at the docks with our luggage.

424
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,112
-成交   -很好
-We have a deal. -Good.

425

426
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,824
不，欠钱仔，我们10分钟后出发
Oh, no, "Frank owes me money," we're gonna depart in 10 minutes.

427
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,701
不 两小时后天就黑了
No, it gets dark in two hours.

428
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:18,785
你想取消吗？
Does it?

429
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,037
我们将在10分钟内出发
We should probably leave in 10 minutes.

430
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,373
选的好
Good decision.

431
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,052
不是现在
Not now.

432
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,888
我说 不是现在
I said, not now.

433
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,108
来来来
Come here.

434
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,944
好乖，普西玛 好姑娘
You did good, Proxima. You're a good girl.

435
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:56,281
有点迟到，咬太用力，但是
You were a little late, and you bit me way too hard.

436
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:58,742
还是干的好
But you did good.

437
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,512
你要在丛林里开化装舞会?
Jungle doesn't care how pretty your dresses are,

438
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,431
别把所有家当带上船
you're never gonna get all your luggage on my boat.

439
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:22,557
不是我的
Not mine.

440
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,729
是我的 我保证
Mine. And, I assure you,

441
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,857
这里每个物品对我的存活都至关重要
every one of these items is entirely necessary for my survival.

442
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,528
真棒 有了这些冗余的重量
Well, with all this extra added weight,

443
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,906
我们永远都无法离开港口 所以 拿走
we'd be lucky to even get out of the harbor, so, no.

444
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:41,534
不穿晚礼服吃晚餐就不叫晚餐，对不对?
Dinner without a dinner jacket is hardly, well, dinner, is it?

445
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:42,619
接招
Now...

446
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:45,455
靠你啰
be a good chap.

447
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,382
你要怎么处理这些鸟
What're you gonna do with those birds?

448
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,258
打包起来送去巴黎
We're gonna stuff them and send them to Paris.

449
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,426
不
No, you're not.

450
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:07,936
你...你在做什么?
What on Earth do you think you're doing?

451
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,774
嘿  麦桂格
Hey!  MacGregor!

452
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,901
给我捡回来喔
That will need to be retrieved immediately.

453
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,569
帮个忙 麦桂格
Help, MacGregor!

454
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:18,613
麦桂格!
MacGregor!

455
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,781

No.

456
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,492
那是我的网球拍耶
Those are my tennis rackets.

457
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:23,576
现在是漂流木了
It's a river cruise.

458
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,747
日装和鞋子?  -丢了
Assorted day wear and shoes? -No.

459

小说和泳装?
Light reading and bathing costumes?

460
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,751
丢了
Good.

461
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:34,963
酒?    -我们会需要它
The liquor?    -That one can stay.

462
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,132
给我停下，你这个四肢发达头脑简单的小丑
Now, listen here, you buffoon,

463
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:39,259
如果你再扔掉这些东西...
if you scuttle any more of my luggage, I will...

464
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,553
天啊 你有好多肌肉
Gosh, there's a lot of you, isn't there?

465
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,430
巨不巨    -莉莉?
Yeah, there is. -Lily?

466
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:45,807
莉莉?
Lily?

467
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,730
嘿
Hey!

468
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,815
他启动引擎了  -喔 我们该走了
Nilo! He's got your engine! -Oh, we gotta go.

469
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:54,941
我的妹妹
Not without my sister.

470
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,317
拿好你的东西 快走
Come on. Get your stuff. Let's go.

471
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,455
女士
Lady!

472
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,251
我们走吧
Let's go.

473
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:16,963
没有沐浴乳我死也不走
I am not leaving without my toiletries.

474
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,174
熄火!
Shut down that engine!

475
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:20,967
欧 该走了
Okay, time to leave.

476
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,473
为什么要追我们?
Why are they chasing us?

477
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,016
我也很莫名其妙
I have no idea.

478
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,059
是个女人，把钱给我
Here's the English woman. Pay up.

479
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:38,568
莉莉
Lily.

480
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,528
急转右舷 维持航向
Turn starboard. Resume heading.

481
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,572
虾米? 啥么意思？
What?  I don't know what that means.

482
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:02,425
小姐...
Lady, look, we gotta...

483
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,802
喔 法兰克 对不起
Oh, God, sorry, Frank.

484
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,136
没关系 拳够硬
It's all right. Strong form.

485
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,518
跟着我 法兰克
Frank, follow me.

486
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:14,229
别往上爬 往这边
Don't go up there. It's that way.

487
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,692
小姐 这个方向才对
Lady, it's that way.

488
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,423
不要管猴子了，他们很快乐
Lady! Leave the monkeys. The monkeys are fine.

489
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:44,175
别往上
Don't go up there.

490
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,565
小姐 别跑了!    -现在不是时候 法兰克
Lady, stop! -Not now, Frank!

491
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,829
还好吗 长裤小姐?
How you doing, Pants?

492
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,289
我很好
I'm good.

493
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:15,456
你知道，我一直想告诉你...
You know, I was trying to tell you about the...

494
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,375
我知道  -来吧
I know. -Come on.

495
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:25,800
不
No.

496
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,760
跳  妹子 跳
Come on! Lady, jump!

497
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:30,096
还在等什么
What are you waiting for?

498
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,514
发现他们了！
There they are!

499
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:50,450
-莉莉呢? -那里
-Where's Lily? -There.

500
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,745
又来了
Of course she is.

501
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,804
来吧，来吧
Okay. Come on, lady.

502
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:33,868
在镇上逛街逛到迷路了?
Tucking in a spot of sightseeing?

503
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,205
欢迎回来，伙计
How nice of you to join us.

504
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:39,374
干嘛不跳河?
Why didn't you jump in the water?

505
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,417
我不想谈论这话题   -她不会游泳
I don't wanna talk about it.  -She can't swim.

506
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,419
所以你租了一艘船 然后怕水
You booked a river cruise, and you can't swim?

507
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,504
我对游泳不感兴趣
I have no intention of swimming.

508
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,339
那20个壮汉又是怎么回事
And what about the 20 guys chasing us around town?

509
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:49,717
我不知道，也许他们对什么感兴趣
I may or may not have something in my possession that

510
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:53,096
也许我有他们感兴趣的东西
may or may not be of interest to other interested parties.

511
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,477
-Shh!

512
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:10,905
我知道她在你眼皮子底下溜走，克塞尔
I assume she escaped your grasp, Axel.

513
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,949
是的，阁下
Yes, your excellency.

514
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:16,619
然后我会帮你收烂摊子
Then I'll take care of it myself.

515
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:20,790
神树是带领德国打胜仗的关键
The Tree is the key to Germany winning this war.

516
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:31,217
圣镞则是带领我们找到神树的关键
The Arrowhead will show us the way to the Tree.

517
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,803
不能让它离开港口
We cannot let it leave this harbor.

518
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,013
上浮!
Surface!

519
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:51,154
那些家伙是谁?    -天啊
Who are those guys? -Oh, my gosh.

520
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,033
我要涨价了
The price just went up.

521
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,092
别这样
Come on!

522
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,720
怎么了   -船失去动力了
What happened? -We lost all power.

523
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,059
重新上弹
Reload!

524
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:24,979
你得帮我掌舵
I need you to take the wheel.

525
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,397
不不不，交给我 我是优秀的司机
No, no, no. I am an excellent driver.

526
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,607
说的就是你 我们唯一的希望
Anyone but you.

527
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,067
记得急转右舷
Starboard.

528
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,151
在他们重新上膛之前
Quick, before he reloads.  -You missed...

529
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,277
是的，船长
Understood.

530
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,822
交给你了  -欧 谢天谢地
It's all yours. -Oh, thank God!

531
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,344
你偷我引擎?
You steal my engine?

532
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:57,887
滚离我的码头
Get off my dock!

533
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,806
这是私人港口，法兰克，你彻底完了
It's private property, Frank. You're finished.

534
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:00,890
掰掰
Ciao.

535
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,945
击沉他们 从他们的尸体上
Sink them and we can recover the Arrowhead

536
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,321
拿回箭镞!

Closer. Closer.

541
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:32,839
莉莉  知道
Lily? Do you know,

542
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,298
法兰克 如果我是你...   -可惜你不是
if I were you, Frank... -Well, you're not me.

543
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,675
有时候只要这样
I just feel that sometimes it just needs a bit of a...

544
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:37,593
除了我，没人可以碰我的引擎
This is my engine. Nobody touches my engine but me.

545
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,389
我才刚说...
What did I just...

546
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:45,893
不客气
There you go.

547
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,189
掰掰啰
Goodbye.

548
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:54,443
那是...
Is that a...

549
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,028
鱼雷  -喔 我的妈呀
Torpedo. -Oh, my God.

550
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:03,202
法兰克 法兰克 法兰克
Frank, Frank, Frank!

551
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:04,704
法兰克 法兰克 法兰克 法兰克!
Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank!

552
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,914
你要干嘛?  -我们跑不赢
What are you doing?   -We can't outrun it.

553
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,453
法兰克!
Frank!

554
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:54,587
噢不
Oh.

555
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:15,441
看看他们对你做了什么 我的小宝贝
Look what they did to you. Poor thing.

556
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,779
机关枪的事我很抱歉
I'm so sorry. Machine guns.

557
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,989
但谁会把潜水艇开进这里呢
Who brings a submarine to the Amazon?

558
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:26,035
但我们又逃脱了 都靠你
But you still outran them. Every time.

559
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:42,093
我决定穿休闲一点
I thought I'd keep it casual.

560
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,512
你又再次超越了自己
Well, you've really outdone yourself this time.

561
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:47,723
那艘潜水艇有什么底细?
Do we know the identity of our homicidal maniac in the submarine?

562
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,183
我不知道名字
No, I don't know his name.

563
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,977
但德国皇帝的小儿子
But the youngest son of Kaiser Wilhelm

564
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,145
写了一篇关于月亮之泪的文章
wrote several articles about the Tears of the Moon.

565
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,481
我猜就是他
And if I had to guess, I would say that that's him.

566
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:58,734
它不热吗
Aren't you hot in all that?

567
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:00,611
一点也不
Not in the slightest.

568
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:04,907
我的眼睛在流汗
My eyeballs are sweating.

569
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:10,663
你还好吗，亲爱的
Are you all right, love?

570
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,757
喔 喔喔 我的天!  麦桂格 快看!
Oh, my... Oh, my goodness! MacGregor, look!

571
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:24,051
亚马逊河海豚!
Inia geoffrensis!

572
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,269
其实我们叫它 迷妖
You know, here we call them "encantado."

573
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,438
令人着魔的意思?  -对 会变身的精灵
"Bewitched"?  -Yeah. Shape-shifter spirits.

574
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:38,399
千万别直视它们的眼睛，除非你这辈子不想再好好睡觉
Don't look them directly in the eye unless you want nightmares for life.

575
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,319
你也相信诅咒，不是吗
You believe in legends, you should believe in curses, too.

576
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,114
好喔
Okay.

577
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:53,581
麦桂格
Hey, MacGregor.

578
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,959
我曾经有一个情人，斗鸡眼严重，后来分了
Had a girlfriend once, she was cross-eyed. Didn't work out.

579
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,502
根本没法集中注意力
We could never see eye to eye.

580
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,214
这是个笑话吗?
Oh, my God. Is that your idea of a joke?

581
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,424
一点也不好笑
That is not funny.

582
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,760
她很可能根本就看不到我的侧脸
I'm also quite sure she was seeing somebody on the side.

583
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:14,935
愚蠢
Silly.

584
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:28,741
法兰克 大部分的人看到镜头都会笑
You know, most people smile when they're on camera, Frank.

585
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,204
这是台让照片动的摄影机
It's a moving picture camera.

586
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,455
可以拍电影，见过吗
Have you never seen one before?

587
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:35,748
我没看过照片会动
I've never seen a moving picture.

588
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:37,083
很有趣的
They're so much fun

589
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:39,668
仿佛你能走遍了整个世界
and you can experience being anywhere in the world.

590
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:40,920
恩
Ah.

591
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,171
但当你身在此林中
Although, why would you want to,

592
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:44,006
何需如此?
if you could be here, surrounded by all this?

593
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,091
这里就
It's just...

594
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,551
好像漂浮在伊甸园里
Oh, it's like drifting through the Garden of Eden.

595
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,845
美不胜收
It's just beautiful.

596
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:52,848
金鸟赫蕉 看过吗?
Look at this. Frank, did you see these heliconias?

597
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,439
你知道在亚马逊的
Do you know there's more individual species

598
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,149
一棵树上的生物多样性都比...
on one tree in the Amazon than there is...

599
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:15,246
麦桂格，你走错方向了
MacGregor, I think you seem to be taking us off course.

600
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:16,539
应该要往那边航行
We should turn that way.

601
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:17,998
不，这方向才对
No, we're good. Stay on course.

602
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,458
哭泣水晶在那个方向
Lagrimas de Cristal is that way.

603
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,540
-法兰克 法兰克…  -他没错
Frank, Frank...  -He's fine.

604
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:23,337
你搞错了   -我没搞错 我才是船长
I'm not mistaken, I'm the skipper.

605
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,256
直直往前走就对了
The Lagrimas de Cristal is straight ahead.

606
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,340
维持方向
Stay on course.

607
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,135
法兰克 地图上标示这里可以通行
Frank, it says on the map that it's passable.

608
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,887
就那条岔路
Here we have that cliff
and exactly that tributary.

609
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:34,014
能省下两天
We can save two days going this way.

610
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:36,142
不能往那，必须往这
We cannot go that way. We have to go that way.

611
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,601
哭泣水晶就往那方向阿
Lagrimas de Cristal is that way.

612
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,478
开往那儿就是激流 你是没体验过吧？
We go that way, it's rapids. You ever been down the rapids?

613
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:40,729
没有 但我知道你有
No, but I presume that you have...

614
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,356
所以我才雇用你
Yes. -...which is why I hired you!

615
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:43,899
就
So just...

616
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:47,695
转弯 右转 急打右舷 随便你怎么说
turn that way. To the right. Starboard. Whatever you call it.

617
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,530
不会游泳的可不是我 长裤小姐
I'm not the one who can't swim, Pants.

618
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:52,199
不用你多管闲事 喘长
Don't you worry about that, Skippy.

619
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:58,332
船长
Lady, it's "Skipper."

620
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,124
我的错
My mistake.

621
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:14,930
这该死的雨林
This godforsaken, endless Amazon,

622
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:18,309
支流太多了吧
with its infinite tangled tributaries.

623
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:22,146
霍顿博士可能带着圣镞跑往任何一个方向
Dr. Houghton and the Arrowhead could be anywhere.

624
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,689
只有一个人
There's only one person

625
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:27,526
曾经与月亮之泪仅一步之遥
who has ever gotten close to the Tears of the Moon.

626
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:31,947
我们去找他谈谈吧，设定新航线
We shall have to ask him directly. We'll set a new course.

627
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:36,202
但阁下，阿吉雷的诅咒…
But, Your Highness, the curse of Don Aguirre...

628
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,914
只是个传说吧?
That's only a legend, right?

629
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,376
我们在这里下锚过夜
We're gonna anchor here for the night.

630
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,463
晚上不是问题吧，我们继续前进啊
Can't we make good time in the dark? Look, we can just keep going.

631
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:50,132
不要 除非你想要引擎过热
No, not unless you want
the engine to overheat.

632
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,802
好吧喘长 今天好累
Tell you what, Skippy. After this day,

633
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:56,722
我想要洗个舒服的澡
I could really do with that luxurious bath of yours.

634
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,183
浴室在下面吗?
Is it, um, down there?

635
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:02,686
长裤小姐，下面没浴室   -啥?
-No, there's no bath down there, Pants.  -What?

636
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,481
下面没浴室 浴室在那边
No, the bath is out there. That's the bath.

637
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:08,776
4300哩的超大奢华澡堂
4,300 miles of luxurious bath.

638
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:11,153
刚用太阳帮你加热的刚好
I also warmed it a little bit for you earlier.

639
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:15,032
对了 我知道你不会游泳 要是不小心溺水
Oh, and I know you don't know how to swim,
so if you happen to drown out there,

640
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:17,868
拿个肥皂，呃，用肥皂把自己洗上岸
go ahead and, uh, use the soap to wash yourself ashore.

641
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,002
我饿了
I could do with something to eat.

642
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:29,922
有人我的食物全丢在码头上了
Someone threw all of my reserve food
into the harbor.

643
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,884
法兰克 你以为饿死我们就能提早回程?
You know, Frank, if you think you're going to cut our trip short by starving us,

644
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:37,179
我告诉你这绝对  非常有可能
let me tell you that   that is extremely likely to work.

645
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:47,189
我还不如去吃...
Do you expect me to eat that?

646
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,240
噢
Oh...

647
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:57,324
食人鱼
Piranha.

648
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:58,617
你应该在它们吃你之前把它们吃掉
Better eat them before they eat you.

649
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:02,705
不可能
No way.

650
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:08,586
我得说 法兰克 出乎意料地好吃
Have to say, Frank. These piranha are so good.

651
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,838
但那是什么味道
Can't quite place that flavor, though.

652
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,006
血的味道
It's blood.

653
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:14,675
噢
Oh.

654
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:23,851
好
Right.

655
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,352
我先睡了
I'm to bed.

656
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:28,522
下面随便你躺，但千万别进我房间，那是禁区
Sleep anywhere you want downstairs, just not in my cabin. It's off-limits.

657
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,524
脑子坏掉才会进你房间
Why on Earth would I want to do that?

658
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,280
真衰
Bugger!

659
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:43,412
不要再盯着我了
You're staring, how do I make it stop?

660
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:46,832
就是穿长裤的女人真的很怪
I'm just not used to seeing a woman in pants, that's all.

661
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:49,752
你对我的穿着真的很有意见，法兰克
Awfully interested in my apparel, Frank.

662
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:51,253
习惯它吧
Get your head around it.

663
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:33,212
那双眼画的真是栩栩如生
You know, you really bring those eyes to life.

664
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,130
不过位置有点...偏
Your perspective's a little off, though.

665
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:36,298
哪有?
What?

666
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:38,509
好吧，你对，你意见真多
Well, you're right, annoyingly.

667
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,094
你会画画吗?   -以前会
Do you draw?  -I used to.

668
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,261
现在不画了?
Why'd you stop?

669
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:43,013
我已经画够了
Well, I drew everything I wanted to draw.

670
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,932
不知道要画什么了
Then I figured I'd learn something new.

671
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:47,768
也许你只是需要刺激
Or perhaps you just need some proper inspiration.

672
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:49,395
你呢?
What about you?

673
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,522
从来不缺刺激
Never lack for inspiration.

674
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:53,524
不，我意思是，你的目的到底是什么?
No, I mean, what're you doing out here?

675
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:57,111
你就喜欢在全世界追着地图跑? 这就你的娱乐?
Chasing maps all over the place? Or is this your idea of fun?

676
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:58,696
月亮之泪    -喔 别再...
The Tears of the Moon... -Oh, come on.

677
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,572
我相信传说是真的
I believe that the legend is real.

678
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,032
可惜不是   -我会找到它
Which it's not. -And I'm gonna find it.

679
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,701
可惜你找不到    -当我发现时
Which you won't.  -And when I do,

680
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:06,203
想像有多少生命能因此获救
just imagine the lives that could be saved.

681
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,456
传说有棵治愈神树能治愈一切
Legend says one petal from the Tree will heal anything.

682
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:11,959
这将永远改变现代医学知识
It will change medicine forever.

683
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,253
掀起一次巨大的科学革命
It's the beginning of a scientific revolution.

684
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:15,671
多么动人心弦 法兰克
It's very exciting, Frank.

685
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,756
你想成为花卉界的达尔文?
So, you wanna be the Darwin of flowers?

686
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,466
我想帮助人类
And I want to help as many people as I can.

687
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,634
你是救世主?
Wanna save the world?

688
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:21,927
我没这么说
I didn't say "save the world."

689
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,011
很高尚
It's very noble.

690
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,805
谢谢赞美    -又愚蠢
Well, thank you. -It's also very stupid.

691
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:27,474
"你真惹人厌"
"You are deeply unpleasant."

692
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,643
走音了啦
And off-key.

693
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:36,233
你宁愿冒着自己和弟弟的生命危险
So, you'd rather risk your life and your brother's life

694
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:37,735
去救你甚至都不认识的人?
to save people you don't even know?

695
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,695
我不需要认识任何人
Well, I don't have to know someone to care.

696
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:41,780
我没有一个可以在乎的人
Well, I don't have to care about anybody, period.

697
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,365
显而易见
That's apparent.

698
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:44,992
听着 人一辈子最重要
Look, I just think if you're lucky enough

699
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,869
就是至少有一个在乎的人
to have one person in this life to care about,

700
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:49,621
我的世界有他足矣
then that's world enough for me.

701
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:51,915
"我的世界有他足矣"
"That's world enough for me."

702
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,000
恩
Hmm.

703
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:58,839
喔 我的天  喔 我的妈呀
Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness! Oh, my...

704
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,007
麦桂格?
MacGregor!

705
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,259
普西玛  普西玛
Proxima! Proxima!

706
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:04,261
坐好 普西玛 坐好
Heel there, Proxima! Proxima, heel.

707
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,763
冷静
Heel.

708
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:06,930
普西玛
Proxima.

709
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,391
这是你的宠物?
This is your cat?

710
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:10,601
所以之前是在?
So, that fight?

711
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:13,228
演戏   -夭寿 法兰克
Faked it.  -For goodness' sake, Frank!

712
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,689
你到底有哪件事能让人信任
Is there a single thing about you that I can trust?

713
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:16,940
一根毛都没法
Not a thing.

714
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,073
时机选的真好啊
Great timing.

715
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:32,039
当地人对这个地方充满恐惧
The natives speak of this place with dread.

716
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:36,418
正是阿吉雷和他的部队试图拿走圣镞
This is where Aguirre and his men were punished

717
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:39,004
永生永世受到诅咒的地方
for trying to steal the Arrowhead.

718
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:49,598
那里
There.

719
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,560
河水
River water.

720
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:59,191
等很久了吧
This is what you have been waiting for.

721
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,480
看看这是谁啊
Look who is here.

722
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:42,359
传说活生生地出现在眼前呢
The legend in the flesh.

723
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:45,863
怀念河流吗?
River water. You want to see more?

724
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:50,450
苦苦等待着重回河边的机会
A long, painful wait to see the river again.

725
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:53,245
月亮之泪可以打破你的诅咒
The Tears of the Moon can break your curse,

726
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:54,872
放你自由
free you from this jungle.

727
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:59,334
你我都想获得月亮之泪
You want what I need.

728
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:01,712
雷管
Detonator.

729
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:09,052
圣镞离我们不远了
The Arrowhead is near.

730
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:14,349
帮我找到
You will find it for me,

731
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:17,644
我们各取其利 怎么样?
and we both get what we want. Deal?

732
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:20,731
你发誓
Swear it.

733
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:23,066
很好
Good.

734
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:20,040
我们快到搅拌机区域了 准备好了吗 长裤女士
All right, we're about to hit the butter churn. Ready, Pants?

735
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,334
你确定只有这条路吗
You sure this is the only way?

736
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:25,087
这可是你选的 你想抄捷径
You picked the route. You wanted to save two days.

737
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:28,006
那个 搅拌机是比喻吗?
Uh, "butter churn," how literal a metaphor?

738
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,257
如果你有贵重物品
If you have anything of value,

739
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:31,176
建议放在甲板下
I would recommend that you store it below deck.

740
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:33,845
我挺贵重的，那就...待会儿见啰
Since I consider myself of value, I will see you all on the other side.

741
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:35,764
等等，等等，等等
Wait a minute. MacGregor. Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

742
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:40,602
保护好它
Do not lose it.

743
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:43,146
看到了吗
You see that?

744
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,315
帮我弄过来
I want you to bring that to me.

745
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:46,900
认识你真是太好了
It's been lovely knowing you.

746
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,527
别讲这种话
Don't say that.

747
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:50,237
去吧
Go.

748
00:49:57,786 --> 00:50:00,497
噢，又是你，走开
Oh, not you again. Go away.

749
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:04,584
你真确定吗 长裤女士
You sure you're up for this, Pants?

750
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,211
开你的船 喘长
Just drive the boat, Skippy.

751
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:09,339
这猫好粗鲁啊
That ruddy cat!

752
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,383
你在干嘛   -她不乖
What are you doing? -She's incessant.

753
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:25,397
来了
Here we go.

754
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:32,821
喔我的天
Oh, my God!

755
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:39,870
还好吗 女士
You okay, lady?

756
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:41,830
我很好   -后悔了吗 长裤
I'm fine.  -You wanna turn back, Pants?

757
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:43,498
好戏才正要开始
Nope. Just getting started.

758
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:46,168
加一
Good. Me, too.

759
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,006
慢点!
Slow down!

760
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:00,682
后悔了吗?
You wanna turn back?

761
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:01,808
开你的船!
Just drive!

762
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:27,417
你尿裤子了 长裤女士
Looks like you wet your pants, Pants.

763
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:28,877
是被水溅到的
That was the wave.

764
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,170
放弃吧
You should give up.

765
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:32,214
你这音痴才该放弃你的吉他
You should give up the guitar.

766
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:48,855
天啊
Oh, my God!

767
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:10,001
来吧，伙计
Come on, buena nina.

768
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:20,762
撑住
Come on!

769
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,335
千万别再来一次
Please don't ever do that again.

770
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:55,130
那咱们掉头去逛小镇 怎么样?
I could turn the boat around and we could head back to town, how's that?

771
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:57,507
不知道原来你这么明智
That may be the first intelligent thing you've said since we met.

772
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:01,845
长裤小姐意下如何?
How about you, Pants?

773
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:03,346
逛小镇?
You ready to go back to town?

774
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:06,558
不要?
No?

775
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:09,519
我其实很享受 呃 这个过程
I actually loved, uh, the whole experience.

776
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:12,230
发现 呃 很来劲
I... I found it, um, exhilarating.

777
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:13,773
你脸色都发青了
You're looking a little green around the gills.

778
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:16,401
别硬撑了 你还行不?
That's why I'm asking.  Are you okay?

779
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:17,944
饿吗
Are you hungry?

780
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:20,697
对 她饿了
Yeah, she's hungry.

781
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:23,575
来条烟薰食人鱼
Have some cured piranha if you think you...

782
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:40,383
你拿到了吗
Did you get it?

783
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:42,802
啊哈
Ugh!

784
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:44,554
你醉了?
You're drunk?

785
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:47,474
从没见过这么弱的猫
You're the worst cat I have ever had.

786
00:53:58,193 --> 00:53:59,653
真不明白你怎么能忍受那女人
I don't know how you live with that woman.

787
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:02,948
才认识两天，我就想把她扔进河里了
I've been with her for two days, and I already wanna throw her overboard.

788
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,325
需要一些时间适应
Does take some getting used to.

789
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:09,746
她有没有没那么...过?
Does she ever stop being so, uh...

790
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:11,873
莉莉?    -对
Lily?  -Yes.

791
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:13,458
恐怕是不可能
Afraid not.

792
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,710
一头栽进去就死不撒手
Headfirst, figure it out on the way down.

793
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:18,880
应该刻在她的拉丁文徽章上
It should be on her crest in Latin.

794
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:24,469
不错
Hmm.

795
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:32,310
在干嘛呢
What you doing?

796
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:39,693
挖自己的坟墓吧
Your funeral.

797
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:49,327
偷瞄一下不行吗
It's just a peek.

798
00:54:57,919 --> 00:55:00,005
你姐想说什么就说什么
Your sister says whatever she wants to say

799
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:01,548
想对谁说就对谁说
to whoever she wants to say it.

800
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,800
都不管人家心里会不会受伤
No regard for anybody's feelings.

801
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:06,761
受伤的往往都是我
Doesn't matter who gets hurt. Usually me.

802
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:09,097
她跟父亲很像
She takes after our father.

803
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:12,225
总是追寻一些不切实际的想法
He was always chasing after some far-fetched idea.

804
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:15,437
这世界上才没有什么诅咒 或治愈神树
There's no such thing as curses. Or cure-alls.

805
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,939
这里已经三个世纪没有征服者经过了
And there hasn't been a conquistador here for three centuries.

806
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,149
恩
Hmm.

807
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,510
那你为何要跟着她东奔西走
So, why'd you follow her out here, then?

808
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:51,681
当我第三次
It was the third time that I'd been presented

809
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:53,224
在马厩前被求婚的时候
with an entirely suitable marriage

810
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:57,312
她是一个迷人、聪明又完美的女人
to a charming, educated woman that sits on a horse well,

811
00:55:58,229 --> 00:56:02,108
但是我当下拒绝了她
that I had to tell the lady in question

812
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:04,361
我没有选择，只能说
that I couldn't accept the offer.

813
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:08,114
我不能娶她 不能娶任何人
Or, indeed, any offer,

814
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:11,409
因为我对她不感兴趣 我对
given that my interests happily lie...

815
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:14,245
别的地方感兴趣
elsewhere.

816
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:20,627
别的地方?
Elsewhere?

817
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:22,962
别的地方
Elsewhere.

818
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,255
喔
Huh.

819
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:26,299
敬 那个地方
Well... To elsewhere.

820
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:35,683
叔叔威胁要剥夺我的继承权
Uncle threatened to disinherit me,

821
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:37,811
家人和朋友全都背我而去
friends and family turned their backs...

822
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:40,897
就因为我喜欢的对象
all because of who I loved.

823
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:44,150
整个社会抛弃我
I would've been ostracized from society

824
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:46,903
但莉莉没有
were it not for Lily.

825
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:50,073
她始终支持我
She stood by me.

826
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:54,160
就这点 我愿意跟随她上刀山下火海
And for that, I would follow her into a volcano.

827
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:09,676
裤子!  该走了!
Pants! Let's shove off!

828
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,057
你要不要解释一下?
Would you care to explain this?

829
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:20,645
说过离我房间远点
I said stay out of my quarters.

830
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:21,938
我想也是
Oh, I bet you did.

831
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:23,440
这样你的秘密才不会被我们发现
So that you could keep more secrets from us.

832
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:26,818
剥开谎言还是谎言 法兰克 你就像一颗洋葱
Just lie upon lie. I mean, Frank, you are like an onion of deceit.

833
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:28,862
什么谎言?    -你曾经找过月亮之泪
What lies?   -That you're after it yourself!

834
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:31,531
我不找了，不再找了
I am not after it! Not anymore.

835
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:35,034
很久很久以前的事了
Not for a long, long time.

836
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:36,911
好吧 没错
Okay, yes,

837
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:39,539
我曾来寻找月亮之泪，跟你一样
I came here seeking the Tears of the Moon, just like you.

838
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:41,166
长这样的地图
I have a map just like yours.

839
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:45,712
好几打长得很像的地图
And a dozen others just like it.

840
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:50,300
阿吉雷的制图师显然灵感泉源不绝
Aguirre's cartographer certainly was prolific.

841
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:53,261
可惜他死后一无所获
Yeah, well, he lost his life searching for something that can't be found.

842
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:57,348
我调查了每个村庄，每个岛屿，每个港口
I've tracked the legend to every village, every island, every shoal.

843
00:57:58,183 --> 00:57:59,559
啥都没有
Nothing.

844
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:02,020
从此我身陷泥潦
And now I'm stuck on this river ever since,

845
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:04,689
真希望我从来没来过这条河
wishing I could be anywhere else but here.

846
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:13,198
但是你没有这个
But you never had this.

847
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:23,541
我要摸你 别咬我
I'm going to pet you now. And you're not going to eat me.

848
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:25,335
懂吗
Understood?

849
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:27,670
慢慢来
Easing in.

850
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,547
准备接触
About to engage.

851
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:33,051
对一只毛茸茸的杀人大猫来说 你其实也不坏
You're not that bad really, are you, for a big, hairy murder cat?

852
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:37,430
我通常不会那么冒犯
I don't usually offend so immediately.

853
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:40,391
莉莉!
Lily!

854
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:42,685
麦桂格
MacGregor.

855
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,027
噢
Oh...

856
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:08,253
我们到底要去哪里
Where are they taking us?

857
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,755
正朝向猎头村
We're headed into headhunter territory,

858
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:13,591
带着头过去会被"猎头"
which is a terrible place to be headed.

859
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:16,135
喔 法兰克 时机很差耶
Oh, Frank, come on, not now.

860
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:17,762
忍不住
I can't turn it off.

861
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,103
莉莉!
Lily!

862
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:26,312
法兰克!
Frank!

863
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:29,232
法兰克
Frank.

864
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,121
麦桂格
...MacGregor...

865
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:31,044
你刚说啥?
What did you say?

866
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:35,048
我告诉他们得放了你们兄妹俩活着离开
I said that they should let you and your brother MacGregor go, and live.

867
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:38,092
并留下所有家当衣服作为交换
In exchange, you'll have to leave all of your things and your clothes,

868
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:39,510
我自个儿留下当人质
and I'll stay back as well.

869
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:40,803
你好勇敢
That's very, very brave.

870
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:43,139
但我不同意，法兰克，我们不可能丢下你
That is not something I agree to, Frank. We're not doing it.

871
01:00:43,222 --> 01:00:45,683
三个人活着离开是不可能的
There's no way that the three of us can get out of this situation alive.

872
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:47,435
我知道这种部落，现在走还有机会...
I know these people. Leave now and let them...

873
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:49,395
不!   -可以给我五分钟
No! -Can I please talk for five minutes

874
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,314
好好听我说话嘛!
-without you interrupting me?

875
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:56,277
噢 你有五分钟了
Oh, now you've done it.

876
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:00,740
噢不
Oh, no.

877
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:05,953
"我唯一想要的"
"The only thing of yours I want

878
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:08,331
"是那个箭头"  - 不可以
"is the Arrowhead."   - No.

879
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:09,874
千万别摇头，他们不喜欢的
Don't shake your head like that. They hate that.

880
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:10,958
他们不喜欢摇头
They hate that. Don't do that.

881
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,046
"我知道你有"
"I know you have it.

882
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,882
"本该属于我们族人的物品"
"It belongs to my people, taken long ago.

883
01:01:18,883 --> 01:01:20,802
"还回来 你就能离开"
"You can return it and go free.

884
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:23,054
"或者让我将它连你手指一起砍下"
"Or I can pry it from your fingers.

885
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:26,557
"再把它从碎肉里取出来"
"After I pick them clean of meat."

886
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:28,393
噢
Oh.

887
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,063
快点，善良的食人族在鼓励你
Come on. You heard the nice cannibal.

888
01:01:32,146 --> 01:01:33,314
还给他们   -我不太擅长
Hand it over.  -I'm a little rusty

889
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:34,899
普卡米那丘话
in the Puka Michuna dialect,

890
01:01:34,982 --> 01:01:38,069
你必须一字不差的翻译
so I want you to translate what I say, word for word.

891
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:39,153
没问题
Okay.

892
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:41,030
不，我不会给你箭镞
No, I cannot give you the Arrowhead.

893
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:42,657
噢 天啊莉莉    -莉莉
Oh, God. Lily.  -Lily.

894
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:43,866
闭嘴，给我翻译
Shut up. Just say it.

895
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:47,078
没错，我是有你们族人的箭镞
Yes, I have the Arrow that belongs to your people.

896
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:51,165
她对箭镞很着迷
She's being weird about the Arrowhead.

897
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:52,667
我会还你们的
I will return it.

898
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,085
她很难搞
She's extremely difficult.

899
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:57,088
但我得先找到月亮之泪
But first I must use it to find the Tears of the Moon.

900
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,589
她真的很顽固
It's hard to be around her.

901
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:01,050
我甘愿因此而死
Now, if I die for that, so be it.

902
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:03,553
她不在乎你们会不会杀了她
She doesn't mind if you kill her.

903
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:05,680
但你得放了我旁边两人离开
But you must let these two men go free.

904
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:08,391
但她求你保我一命
Just don't kill me.

905
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:12,353
莉莉!
Lily!

906
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:15,356
来啊 跟我打架 你 跟我打架啊
Come on, fight me. You, come on, fight me.

907
01:02:15,523 --> 01:02:17,233
快啊 你有什么毛病
Go! Do it! What's wrong with you?

908
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,943
莉莉...
Lily...

909
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:30,204
法兰克 认真的
Seriously, Frank.

910
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:33,124
你要这不嘎不嘎的套路，下次要付更多钱
Next time I'm going to charge you more for this "booga-booga" nonsense.

911
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:34,500
山姆 我们说好的 好吗
Sam, we had a deal, okay?

912
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,919
不 不 我已经厌倦了你这愚蠢的服装
No, no. I'm tired, and this is a whole production,

913
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:38,671
和你的耍猴烂戏
with these ridiculous costumes!

914
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:40,006
你明明就说
And you told me

915
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:42,842
会是一个天真的女孩和一个懦弱的哥哥
this was a nice English lady with her wimpy brother.

916
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:44,427
结果她宁愿自杀?
And she's gonna get herself killed.

917
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:46,053
我知道 她根本是疯...子
I know, because she's crazy!

918
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:48,973
疯狂的顽固份子
She's crazy determined.

919
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:52,143
莉莉，我坦白，我没机会取消这个桥段
Lily, listen, the truth is I didn't get a chance to call this entire thing off.

920
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:55,104
如果你信以为真，很抱歉这只是个骗局
Remember, it's only a scam if you fall for it.

921
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:01,068
别再这样做了
You've gotta stop doing that.

922
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:02,737
懦弱 哈?   -强而有力的懦弱
Wimpy, eh?   -In a strong way.

923
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:08,910
拳头真硬  你全家都有够硬
Strong form. The whole family has strong form.

924
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:12,872
你能破译它吗?
Can you translate it?

925
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:14,791
有机会
Possibly.

926
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:19,712
可能，但是你知道，有点障碍
Possibly, but, you know, there are some impediments.

927
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:23,299
你有所求的时候英语说得可真标准
Your English gets very exact when you want something.

928
01:03:23,424 --> 01:03:26,135
有一种要谈价格的预感
I have the tingling impression we're to negotiate a price.

929
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:27,345
你懂我
You get me.

930
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:29,305
"商人山姆 "喜欢做交易
Trader Sam likes a trade.

931
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:30,932
果不其然
Oh, I bet.

932
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:34,644
喜欢帽子吗?  -恩...
Would you like that hat? -Hmm.

933
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:35,853
它是你的了
You can have that hat.

934
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:42,026
你做的真成功
You've really done it now.

935
01:03:44,695 --> 01:03:47,490
她会原谅我吗?   -想得美
You think she'll get over it?  -Not likely.

936
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:50,993
我不是针对你们 这计划已经安排很久了
It wasn't personal, you know. It was a pre-existing arrangement.

937
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,496
敢这样背叛莉莉，你已经死透千百万次
Cross Lily like that and you are dead to her.

938
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,957
烧成灰烬
Dead and buried.

939
01:03:56,874 --> 01:03:58,292
尸骨无存
Entombed.

940
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:01,504
烧成灰烬尸骨无存   -好好 我明白了
Embalmed and entombed. -I got it.

941
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:03,673
像渡渡鸟一样从地球上消失   -好了 够清楚了
Dead as a dodo.   -You're making it very clear.

942
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,299
死掉 灭绝 消失   -麦先生
Dead, dead, dead.  -MacGregor.

943
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:06,717
这啤酒还不错耶
This beer's actually rather nice.

944
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:08,803
是唾酵而成的   -恩哼
It's masato.  -Hmm.

945
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:11,931
口水发酵而成的
It's made out of fermented spit.

946
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:13,641
你在喝别人的口水
You're drinking spit.

947
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:20,606
有一次我在罗马...
When in Rome.

948
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:26,070
天啊 真希望我在罗马
God, I wish I was in Rome.

949
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:28,531
"月亮之泪"
"The Tears of the Moon

950
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:33,536
"拥有治愈一切的力量"
"possess the power to cure anything."

951
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:36,706
看看这个字
Now, this word here,

952
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:39,333
英语中没有对应的文字 意思是...
there's no exact translation in English. It's...

953
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:43,337
一种对灵魂的
a pain to...

954
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:46,841
折磨...
the soul.

955
01:04:49,093 --> 01:04:50,094
治疗 治疗
Heal. Heal.

956
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:52,638
一种对灵魂的治疗
Heal the soul.

957
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:53,723
差不多
Pretty much.

958
01:04:53,806 --> 01:04:54,891
恩恩 治疗
Mm-hmm. Heal.

959
01:04:56,392 --> 01:05:00,396
"要证明你的价值，必须化水为石"
"To prove yourself worthy, you must turn water to stone.

960
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:03,149
"并修补一颗破碎的心"
"Then mend a broken heart."

961
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:04,609
噢
Ooh.

962
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:09,822
"让泪水绽放..."
"For Tears to bloom,

963
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:13,075
"让大树在月下哭泣"
"the great Tree must be under the rare crying Moon."

964
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:15,161
两天后就是新月了
There is one in two days.

965
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:17,580
"月亮流血之处"
"The Tree hides

966
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:19,081
"将是树木藏身之处"
"where the Moon bled.

967
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:22,919
"月将从西边落下，割过蛇的心脏"
"It sank into the west, over the heart of the serpent."

968
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:24,045
蛇
Serpent.

969
01:05:25,212 --> 01:05:27,548
"在毒牙咬尾之处"
"Where the fang bites its own tail..."

970
01:05:28,507 --> 01:05:31,594
"在毒牙咬尾之处"  喔 我的天
"Where the fang bites its tail." Oh, my goodness.

971
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,471
就说这很复杂了吧
Now, I told you it was complicated.

972
01:05:33,554 --> 01:05:34,639
难怪没人找的到
Of course no one's ever found it.

973
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:36,515
没错，根本就不在哭泣水晶
Right, because it's not in Lagrimas de Cristal.

974
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:37,975
是这里  碎月之地
It's here. La Luna Rota.

975
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:39,060
没错
Yes.

976
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:43,189
你觉得多久能到
How long would you say it would take me to get down there?

977
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:44,273
两天或三天吧
Two or three days.

978
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:45,650
搭独木舟呢
What about via canoe?

979
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:46,734
你说什么?
Excuse me?

980
01:05:46,817 --> 01:05:50,071
跟喘船长说我从现在开始一个人走
Please inform Captain Skippy that I will be traveling alone from now on.

981
01:05:50,154 --> 01:05:51,489
你不会一个人 莉莉
You're never gonna make it alone, Lily.

982
01:05:51,572 --> 01:05:54,700
告诉他低估了我的决心 还有我的操船技术
Please tell him that he misjudges my determination, also my driving skills.

983
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:57,787
那么请告诉裤子博士 雨林有多危险
Please tell Dr. Pants that what's out there in the jungle,

984
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:00,289
告诉她 这可不是在读小说
she's never read about in her little textbooks. Tell her that.

985
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:02,792
哈 我不会再被你可笑的把戏玩弄的
Well, I'm not gonna be falling for any more of his ludicrous tricks.

986
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:03,918
你的玩笑越来越鸡肋了
They're getting really tedious.

987
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:06,003
如果你戴着那玩意儿独自往上游
If you go upriver by yourself with that thing around your neck,

988
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:07,254
没办法活着回来   -这样啊
you're never gonna make it out alive.  -Really?

989
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:08,339
我们得团结一心
We have to stick together.

990
01:06:08,422 --> 01:06:09,715
我们?  -对 我们
Do we? -Yes, we do.

991
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:11,050
"我们"是个挺耐人寻味的词 法兰克
"We" is an interesting word, Frank.

992
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:13,970
没有诚实和信任，似乎行不通喔
Because it sort of implies a bond of trust and honesty.

993
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:17,306
不过你也不懂 因为你就是个骗子 法兰克
Neither of which you know anything about, because you are a liar, Frank.

994
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:19,558
自私又自大
You are selfish, you are arrogant,

995
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:21,852
我打死不会再相信你，能扔你多远有多远
and I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw you,

996
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:24,105
大概也不远 因为你满大的
which clearly isn't very far, because you are huge.

997
01:06:24,188 --> 01:06:25,982
所以 再也没有"我们"
So, there is no more "we," actually.

998
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:27,733
剩下的12,000就此结清
In fact, here's the rest of your 12,000.

999
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:31,028
噢 这些小费用来感谢你丰富的安排
Oh, and here's a tip for such wonderful service.

1000
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:37,743
这是把球杆
This one is a driver.

1001
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:39,537
"球杆"
TRIBESPEOPLE: Driver.

1002
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:42,957
没错，任何你想要打去远方的东西 就靠他
Yes. Use that for anything over 200 yards.

1003
01:06:43,874 --> 01:06:46,210
你还需要 铁杆
Under that, you'll need an iron.

1004
01:06:50,047 --> 01:06:52,591
战妆  真酷
War paint? Righto, yes.

1005
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:55,344
我是战士 来吧
For a warrior. Dilly!

1006
01:06:58,347 --> 01:06:59,724
有点痒
Tickles.

1007
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:04,395
感觉不会脱落
This doesn't appear to be coming off.

1008
01:07:04,478 --> 01:07:07,314
这是纹身染料，会脱落的
That's 'cause it's tattoo ink. It'll come off eventually.

1009
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:08,774
几十年后吧
In a few decades.

1010
01:07:08,941 --> 01:07:10,109
喔 惨了
Oh, no.

1011
01:07:15,406 --> 01:07:18,075
法兰西斯科...
Francisco...

1012
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:44,477
莉莉!    -噢 法兰克 干嘛
Lily!  -Oh... Frank, what?

1013
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:45,978
我们得马上离开  -什么?
We have to get out of here now. -What?

1014
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:47,897
-给我圣镞   -当我白痴吗?
-Give me the Arrowhead. -Do you think I'm a fool?

1015
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:49,106
你一定觉得我很好唬弄
I think you must think I'm a fool.

1016
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:52,693
法兰西斯科...
Francisco...

1017
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:56,989
法兰西斯科...
Francisco...

1018
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:02,244
发生什么事?  -我正要告诉你
What's going on?   -That's what I was trying to tell you.

1019
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:14,256
不
No.

1020
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:18,803
你好像很惊讶
You seem surprised.

1021
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:20,805
传说应验了
It's impossible.

1022
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:25,559
神话是真的
The myth is real.

1023
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:27,311
辗转了四百年
After 400 years...

1024
01:08:27,478 --> 01:08:28,604
圣镞
The Arrowhead...

1025
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:29,814
该还给我了
...belongs to me.

1026
01:08:33,025 --> 01:08:34,360
快去救大家   -好!
Save your family!  -Yes!

1027
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:38,155
喔 天啊
Oh, God!

1028
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:41,742
法兰克 法兰克 法兰克!
Frank, Frank! Frank!

1029
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:27,329
快点 我抓住你 裤姐 相信我
Come on. I got you, Pants. Trust me.

1030
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:30,708
抓紧了!
Hold on!

1031
01:09:36,213 --> 01:09:37,840
法兰克? 法兰克  勾住
Frank? Frank, get it.

1032
01:09:39,383 --> 01:09:40,384
快好了   -加把劲
Hold on. -Come on.

1033
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:43,429
法兰克 加把劲  -我勾得住
Frank, please.  -I got it.

1034
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:44,597
法兰克   -我勾不住
Frank.  -I don't got it.

1035
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:45,681
法兰克!!  -妈妈咪啊!
Frank!  -Oh, my God!

1036
01:09:48,559 --> 01:09:51,103
放我下来啦 在干嘛啦!   -我在设法利用地心引力
Frank, get off me! What're you doing? -I'm trying to get traction.

1037
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:52,688
这太荒唐了，让我走！  -不 一下下就好
This is ridiculous! -No, no, wait.

1038
01:09:52,771 --> 01:09:54,607
放我下来啦!  根本灾难...
Just leave me alone! That was a disaster!

1039
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:55,774
你太重了
You're too heavy.

1040
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:56,942
麦桂格!
MacGregor!

1041
01:09:57,109 --> 01:09:58,319
莉莉?
Lily?

1042
01:09:58,736 --> 01:09:59,737
抱歉
Sorry.

1043
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:31,018
放开她
Get off her!

1044
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:38,901
不!   -阿吉雷!
No! -Aguirre!

1045
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:55,125
球杆
Driver.

1046
01:10:55,292 --> 01:10:56,543
老兄 射的真准  -圣镞
Lovely shot, sir.  -The Arrow.

1047
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:23,445
不!
No!

1048
01:11:24,738 --> 01:11:25,906
法兰克!
Frank!

1049
01:11:40,337 --> 01:11:41,630
我们该走了 快来
We gotta go! Come on!

1050
01:11:42,214 --> 01:11:44,174
进去 拿那把刀!
Get in! Grab that knife!

1051
01:11:45,009 --> 01:11:46,010
就是现在!
Now!

1052
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,141
你怎么了? 你做了什么?
Are you all right? What have you done?

1053
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:54,810
没事 没事
It's all right. It's all right.

1054
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:58,772
快走 离开这片河域 再也不要回头
You must go. Get out of sight of the river and run.

1055
01:11:58,939 --> 01:12:00,399
阿吉雷只想要圣镞
Aguirre only wants the Arrowhead.

1056
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:02,443
尽全力跑  -快
Just run as fast as you can. -Go.

1057
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:05,154
他们追来了! 快! 远离这片河域
They're coming! Go! Get away from the river!

1058
01:12:15,622 --> 01:12:16,623
我抓到她了
I have her!

1059
01:12:17,624 --> 01:12:18,625
不
No!

1060
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:20,044
给我圣镞!
Give me the Arrowhead!

1061
01:12:21,962 --> 01:12:23,714
阿吉雷 我们离河流太远了!
Aguirre, we're too far from the river!

1062
01:12:44,651 --> 01:12:46,028
喔 我的天
Oh, my God!

1063
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:48,655
没事 没事，是我，是我
It's cool. It's me. It's me.

1064
01:12:54,495 --> 01:12:55,537
有看到圣镞吗?
Did you see the Arrowhead?

1065
01:12:56,246 --> 01:12:57,289
有看到没?
Have you really seen it?

1066
01:12:57,456 --> 01:12:59,708
我不只看到，还拿手上呢
Not only have I seen it, I held it in my hands.

1067
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,251
终于能解开诅咒了
Finally we can break the curse...

1068
01:13:01,418 --> 01:13:02,961
法兰西斯科该偿命了
and Francisco shall pay.

1069
01:13:03,128 --> 01:13:05,547
别管法兰西斯科了，阿吉雷，我们要圣镞
Forget about Francisco! The Arrowhead, Aguirre!

1070
01:13:05,964 --> 01:13:09,218
找到月亮之泪才能解开我们的诅咒
Only the Tears of the Moon can help us get out of this curse.

1071
01:13:09,593 --> 01:13:11,553
这片丛林快把我们吃光抹净了
This jungle is devouring our souls.

1072
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:13,305
现在这样真恶心
We are disgusting.

1073
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:16,141
那是你 我香的很
Speak for yourself. I am delicious.

1074
01:13:18,102 --> 01:13:20,604
你觉得我们的灵魂还在吗
Do you really believe we still have souls?

1075
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:25,192
所以才需要月亮之泪 那是唯一的希望
That's why we need the Tears of the Moon, they are our only hope.

1076
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:27,986
那个穿长裤的女人拿走圣镞了
The woman in pants has the Arrowhead...

1077
01:13:28,153 --> 01:13:29,863
远离了河边
and has taken it away from the river.

1078
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:31,865
她知道我们没办法离开太远
Because she knows we can't follow her there.

1079
01:13:32,032 --> 01:13:33,200
王子
The Prince.

1080
01:13:35,285 --> 01:13:37,413
王子可以
He can follow the Arrowhead.

1081
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,415
叫他去追
Tell him where she went.

1082
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:40,833
你听到了
You heard him.

1083
01:13:40,999 --> 01:13:42,709
去通知王子
Tell the Prince.

1084
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:47,172
麦桂格!
MacGregor!

1085
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:50,759
麦桂格!
MacGregor!

1086
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:52,219
麦桂格!
MacGregor!

1087
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:54,930
麦桂格!
MacGregor!

1088
01:14:08,485 --> 01:14:09,653
法兰克?
Frank?

1089
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:11,822
法兰克 你还活着
Frank, you're alive.

1090
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:13,991
你还活着，但怎么会呢
How? How are you alive, Frank?

1091
01:14:15,075 --> 01:14:16,535
我亲眼看到你死掉
I saw you die.

1092
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:18,203
你摔落下去了 怎么还活着
I saw you fall. How are you alive?

1093
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:19,872
莉莉，不管你曾经为我做了什么
Lily, I don't care what you've done for me,

1094
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:21,957
如果我们能活着离开这里...   -噢 你在这
if we make it out of here alive... -Oh, there you are.

1095
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,667
我再也不会离开肯辛顿
...I am never leaving Kensington again.

1096
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:26,044
对 他还活者
Yeah. Frank's alive.

1097
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:28,213
哦 恩 那个
Huh. Oh, um...

1098
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:32,384
你背后有东西
You've got a little, um, something in your back.

1099
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:36,805
法兰克?
Frank?

1100
01:14:37,931 --> 01:14:40,058
法兰西斯科才对
The name's actually Francisco.

1101
01:14:41,351 --> 01:14:43,896
法兰西斯科-洛佩斯-德-埃雷迪亚
Francisco Lopez de Heredia.

1102
01:14:44,062 --> 01:14:45,272
而且
And...

1103
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:48,567
我大概有400岁了
I'm roughly 400 years old.

1104
01:14:49,276 --> 01:14:50,903
什么鬼?  -我知道一时很难接受
What?  -I know it's a lot to take in.

1105
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:54,364
待我娓娓道来   -你没流血
I will explain to you the entire story...  -There's no blood in you.

1106
01:14:54,448 --> 01:14:55,449
你是鬼吗?
Are you a ghost?

1107
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:57,117
不 有点复杂
No, it's complicated.

1108
01:14:57,451 --> 01:15:00,370
但 你 你很明显不是人类
But clearly you're... you're not a human.

1109
01:15:00,537 --> 01:15:03,707
好 好吧 但刀子插在我心脏上 我有点难专心
Okay, but it's very hard to focus when I have a sword impaled in my heart.

1110
01:15:04,082 --> 01:15:05,459
山姆 帮我一把
Trader Sam, I need you to come and pull.

1111
01:15:05,542 --> 01:15:06,543
吸血鬼?
Vampire?

1112
01:15:06,627 --> 01:15:09,087
我说过了 我不想再从你身上拔出任何东西
I told you last time, I'm done pulling weapons out of you.

1113
01:15:11,298 --> 01:15:12,341
噢 不
Oh, no.

1114
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:16,845
你是 是博士 对吧
It is, uh, Dr. Houghton, right?

1115
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:18,597
植物学
Of Botany.

1116
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:20,724
哇 它完全刺穿了
Look at it. It's just hanging out like that.

1117
01:15:20,807 --> 01:15:22,392
剑就是这么用的
Well, it's how it's made.

1118
01:15:22,476 --> 01:15:23,560
刀片的形状很奇怪
It's got a very strange shape.

1119
01:15:23,644 --> 01:15:25,896
看到了吗？就 那样...
Have you seen it out the back? It's like... Woo... Like that.

1120
01:15:25,979 --> 01:15:28,440
不，它 它就是直直的刺穿了
Well, it's not... It's kinda actually just straight.

1121
01:15:29,566 --> 01:15:31,318
我要一只手吗 还是两手一起
One hand, two hand, what do you want?

1122
01:15:31,401 --> 01:15:32,402
先试试一只
Let's try one.

1123
01:15:35,447 --> 01:15:37,074
看来你需要两只
You're gonna need two hands.

1124
01:15:38,116 --> 01:15:39,117
不 不 不!
No, no, no!

1125
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:41,328
怎么 怎么...?   -喔天啊 痛死了
What, what, what? -Oh, my gosh! That hurts.

1126
01:15:41,411 --> 01:15:42,704
才怪    -你又知道?
No, it doesn't. -How do you know?

1127
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:45,290
法兰克 想要咬我的棒子吗?
Frank, would you like to bite down on my stick?

1128
01:15:45,457 --> 01:15:47,209
不 我不是..我不要 谢谢!  -我意思是...
Nope. I'm good. Thank you.  -No, for the pain.

1129
01:15:47,292 --> 01:15:48,418
我知道你的意思
I understand what it...

1130
01:15:48,502 --> 01:15:49,586
他的意思... 但是，不要
What he means. But no.

1131
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:51,129
永远为你准备好
There if you need it.

1132
01:15:51,296 --> 01:15:52,923
我觉得你太紧绷了
I just feel like you're very uptight right now.

1133
01:15:53,006 --> 01:15:54,675
这样无济于事 我已经够紧张了
And it's not helping me 'cause I'm very nervous.

1134
01:15:54,758 --> 01:15:56,301
没关系 人总有第一次
It's okay to be nervous. It's your first time.

1135
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:57,928
第一次对吧?
It is your first time, right?

1136
01:15:58,011 --> 01:15:59,972
废话 法兰克   -我懂 我懂 看的出来
Yes, you know it is, Frank. -I know, I know. I can tell.

1137
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:01,807
我拔过上百次了
I've done this hundreds of times.

1138
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:03,809
我不知道怎么出力 法兰克    -这把很特别
I don't know how to take that, Frank. -This is special.

1139
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:05,185
有吗   -很特别
Is it? -It is.

1140
01:16:05,269 --> 01:16:06,395
慢点!   -干嘛?
Slow! -What?

1141
01:16:06,478 --> 01:16:07,688
这样行不通的
Oh, you can't do it like that.

1142
01:16:07,771 --> 01:16:08,855
好难   -法兰克
That's way too hard. -Frank.

1143
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:10,065
需要我帮忙边拔边转吗
Would you like me to give it a wiggle?

1144
01:16:10,148 --> 01:16:11,149
这个好   -不可以!
Yes. Yes. -Absolutely not.

1145
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:12,901
我从后面推 一次解决怎么样
I could pop around the back and give it a once over.

1146
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:15,028
不 这样够了   -好吧
No, we're good. -Okay.

1147
01:16:15,195 --> 01:16:18,198
这可能有用 脚蹬着他
You know what always helps? If you put your foot on it.

1148
01:16:18,323 --> 01:16:20,242
我有点紧张 -不用紧张
I'm a little nervous.  -Don't be nervous.

1149
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:22,286
法兰克，我数到三
Frank, I'm gonna count to three.

1150
01:16:22,369 --> 01:16:23,870
你会直接...还是我来数
You're gonna... I'm counting or...

1151
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:25,038
我数
No, I'm counting.

1152
01:16:25,122 --> 01:16:26,873
一       -啊啊啊!
One.  -'Cause... Ahhh!

1153
01:16:35,841 --> 01:16:38,427
我梦见我在一个俱乐部里吃饭
I dreamt I was lunching at Boodle's.

1154
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:40,429
博士，来吧
Hey, Doctor.

1155
01:16:41,638 --> 01:16:42,848
该走了  -当然
We should go. -Of course.

1156
01:16:42,931 --> 01:16:44,433
不 你为我做够多了
No. You've done enough.

1157
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,101
不能把你一个人丢在外面
I can't leave you alone out here.

1158
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:49,062
你看看你 根本走不动
Look at the state of you. And you can't even walk.

1159
01:16:49,229 --> 01:16:51,189
你会回来吧?
Will you at least consider turning back?

1160
01:16:52,482 --> 01:16:55,235
我会没事的 保证
I will be fine. I promise.

1161
01:17:00,574 --> 01:17:01,700
我闻起来?
Do I smell?

1162
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:03,410
遭透了
Horrendously.

1163
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:19,926
有客人，打开舱门
We have visitors. Open the hatch.

1164
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:37,903
午安 朋友们
Good afternoon, my friends.

1165
01:17:46,244 --> 01:17:47,329
那儿有东西吗?
Something is there?

1166
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:52,167
找到啥了? 你找到他们的渡轮了吗
What is there? You have found their river boat?

1167
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:55,879
没有?
No?

1168
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:58,840
没有船，那圣镞呢?
Not the river boat? The Arrowhead?

1169
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:04,346
圣镞? 对 在哪里
The Arrowhead? Yes. Show... Show me where.

1170
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:06,640
一只蜜蜂在对我们发号施令耶
We're taking orders from a bee.

1171
01:18:06,723 --> 01:18:07,849
在地图上指一下
Show me on the map.

1172
01:18:10,477 --> 01:18:11,520
这?
Here?

1173
01:18:11,645 --> 01:18:13,605
对 你听到了没 改变航向!
Yes! You heard him. Change course!

1174
01:18:16,149 --> 01:18:18,193
可以请蜜蜂说一下坐标吗
Could you ask the bee for coordinates?

1175
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:22,364
少得寸进尺 克赛尔
Don't be ridiculous, Axel.

1176
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:25,992
谢谢
Thank you.

1177
01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:33,834
过了395年
395 years...

1178
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,712
5个月又13天
...five months and 13 days.

1179
01:18:36,795 --> 01:18:38,672
真以为你死了
I really thought you died.

1180
01:18:41,967 --> 01:18:43,176
你有难过吗?
Were you sad when I died?

1181
01:18:43,343 --> 01:18:45,137
我很关心
I was very concerned.

1182
01:18:45,262 --> 01:18:46,263
我的灵魂
For my soul.

1183
01:18:46,346 --> 01:18:47,514
我的探险
For my expedition.

1184
01:18:49,641 --> 01:18:50,642
还有你
And for you.

1185
01:18:55,188 --> 01:18:56,565
你到底是什么
So, what are you?

1186
01:18:57,107 --> 01:18:59,651
不流血，但是会呼吸
You don't bleed, I think you breathe.

1187
01:19:00,944 --> 01:19:02,404
根本不可能
You're not possible.

1188
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:04,531
我搞不清楚我现在是什么
I don't know what I am anymore.

1189
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:07,659
但是我可以告诉你我曾经是什么
But I can tell you what I was.

1190
01:19:10,662 --> 01:19:12,372
我父亲是雇佣兵
My father was a mercenary

1191
01:19:12,539 --> 01:19:17,127
当时在阿尔及尔被阿吉雷父亲招募到麾下
and he was recruited by Aguirre's father in Algiers.

1192
01:19:20,213 --> 01:19:22,883
当我父亲代他而死时，他收留了我
When my father died protecting him, he took me in.

1193
01:19:23,049 --> 01:19:25,969
把我和阿吉雷当亲兄弟一样扶养
Raised Aguirre and me together, like brothers.

1194
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:28,555
后来阿吉雷的女儿生了重病
Aguirre's daughter Anna had fallen ill.

1195
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:32,225
阿吉雷只有一个孩子，所以不顾一切想救活她
She was all he had. He vowed he wouldn't lose her.

1196
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:34,436
我需要离开一阵子
I will travel far.

1197
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:37,731
但我会带着月亮之泪回来的
But I will come back to you with a Tear of the Moon.

1198
01:19:38,815 --> 01:19:41,234
你可以再次在月光下奔跑
And you will run again in the moonlight.

1199
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:42,486
无病无痛地
Healed.

1200
01:19:54,873 --> 01:19:58,168
我们征服了大海 却栽在河流里
We fought the ocean, only to be beaten by the river.

1201
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:01,338
雨林让我们举步维艰
The jungle fought our every step.

1202
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:04,174
为了月亮之泪，我不惜一切
I would've done anything to find the Tears of the Moon

1203
01:20:04,257 --> 01:20:05,717
去拯救阿吉雷的女儿
and save Aguirre's daughter.

1204
01:20:05,926 --> 01:20:07,469
绘出整片亚马逊地型
Even chart the Amazon.

1205
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:14,518
你是阿吉雷的制图师?
You were Aguirre's cartographer?

1206
01:20:15,352 --> 01:20:16,686
我的地图是你画的?
You drew my map?

1207
01:20:18,313 --> 01:20:19,523
法兰克...
Frank...

1208
01:20:19,606 --> 01:20:21,191
怎么样 我画得不错吧
Really think my work is extraordinary?

1209
01:20:21,274 --> 01:20:23,652
我同意 你是个小大师级的画家
I think you were a minor master of your time.

1210
01:20:23,735 --> 01:20:24,736
小大师?
Minor?

1211
01:20:29,741 --> 01:20:32,035
队员一个接着一个被雨林带走
One by one, the jungle took us.

1212
01:20:33,745 --> 01:20:37,082
但即使面对死亡，阿吉雷仍在坚持
We were all but dead. Still, Aguirre wouldn't turn back.

1213
01:20:39,084 --> 01:20:41,878
失去女儿 他就失去了活下去的意义
There was no world for him without his daughter in it.

1214
01:20:42,796 --> 01:20:43,922
然后他们来了
And then they came.

1215
01:20:46,383 --> 01:20:49,886
如果不是因为月亮之泪，我们早就已经死了
We would've all died had they not saved us with the Tears of the Moon.

1216
01:20:50,178 --> 01:20:52,013
花瓣的魔法是真的
The petal's magic was real.

1217
01:20:52,889 --> 01:20:56,142
酋长和酋长之女释放了治愈之力
Its powers unlocked by the Chief and his daughter.

1218
01:20:57,352 --> 01:21:00,063
花瓣所到之处
All that was broken, the petals mended.

1219
01:21:00,564 --> 01:21:03,191
一下就恢复，很快就被治愈了
And all at once, we were revived.

1220
01:21:04,818 --> 01:21:05,944
阿吉雷开心死了
And Aguirre was happy,

1221
01:21:06,027 --> 01:21:09,406
救活女儿的希望是如此接近
because he was closer than ever to finding a cure for his daughter.

1222
01:21:13,326 --> 01:21:14,744
但他开始变得没耐心
But he grew impatient.

1223
01:21:18,582 --> 01:21:21,042
他跟部落索要圣镞
Aguirre demanded they give him the Arrowhead

1224
01:21:21,459 --> 01:21:22,502
并带他去治愈之树底下
and take him to the Tree.

1225
01:21:22,752 --> 01:21:24,337
你不够格
You are not worthy.

1226
01:21:25,046 --> 01:21:26,298
酋长拒绝了
The Chief refused.

1227
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:34,723
尽管族人慷慨施予我们新生
Despite all the kindness they'd shown us,

1228
01:21:35,682 --> 01:21:37,058
阿吉雷却痛下杀手 赶尽杀绝
he would've killed every last one of them.

1229
01:21:40,478 --> 01:21:41,771
圣镞在她那!
She has the Arrowhead!

1230
01:21:43,523 --> 01:21:45,901
阿吉雷是我手足，但是我没法接受屠杀
I loved Aguirre, but I couldn't be part of the madness.

1231
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:47,402
我不会害你
I'm not going to hurt you.

1232
01:21:47,485 --> 01:21:48,737
我只想要圣镞
I only want the Arrowhead.

1233
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:50,822
但我也没办法袖手旁观
And I couldn't just stand by.

1234
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:52,073
交出来!
Give it to me!

1235
01:21:55,035 --> 01:21:56,077
跑!
Run!

1236
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,121
不!
No!

1237
01:21:58,413 --> 01:22:00,707
兄弟之情伤人最深
A brother's blade cuts deepest.

1238
01:22:00,874 --> 01:22:02,250
你这个叛徒
Traitor.

1239
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:21,186
酋长知道自己大去之期不远矣
The Chief knew he was breathing his last breath.

1240
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:23,647
他用最后一口气来守护圣镞
And he used that breath to protect the Arrowhead

1241
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:25,231
和他们的神树
and their sacred Tree.

1242
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:26,900
降下诅咒到阿吉雷身上
He cursed Aguirre.

1243
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:31,071
到我们所有人身上 永生永世不得离开河边
He cursed all of us, so that we could never leave sight of the river again.

1244
01:22:31,237 --> 01:22:33,031
她往哪跑了?   -跑不远的!
Where did she go? -She can't be far!

1245
01:22:33,114 --> 01:22:36,743
丛林会一次又一次把我们拖回去
Or the jungle would take us back to it, for all eternity.

1246
01:22:49,005 --> 01:22:51,091
阿吉雷恨我入骨
Aguirre hated me for betraying him.

1247
01:22:51,257 --> 01:22:54,135
经年累月追着我跑，我们打斗
He found me over the years, and we fought.

1248
01:22:56,179 --> 01:22:57,180
一次又一次
And fought again.

1249
01:23:00,684 --> 01:23:02,477
我不想再被捅刀了
I got tired of being stabbed.

1250
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:05,480
所以把他们引入山洞陷阱
So I made sure he would never hurt me or anyone else again.

1251
01:23:08,608 --> 01:23:10,151
确保再也碰不到我
I trapped them in a cave.

1252
01:23:10,318 --> 01:23:11,361
河流!
The river!

1253
01:23:11,444 --> 01:23:12,445
在哪?
Where is it?

1254
01:23:12,529 --> 01:23:15,115
丛林没法再把他们拖回河边
Where the jungle couldn't take them back to the river.

1255
01:23:15,198 --> 01:23:16,449
快离开这里!
We have to get out of here!

1256
01:23:29,045 --> 01:23:31,172
法兰西斯科 你会偿命的!
Francisco, you will pay for this!

1257
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:37,053
往后300年 丛林蹂躏他们的身体
And for 300 years, the jungle ravaged their bodies.

1258
01:23:37,137 --> 01:23:39,305
于是他们就变成了现在这副模样
Turning them into the monsters they are today.

1259
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:42,851
不知道他们是怎么被释放的
I don't know how they got free,

1260
01:23:43,643 --> 01:23:45,228
总之我好长一段时间都安安稳稳的
but I was safe for a long time.

1261
01:23:45,979 --> 01:23:47,105
那你都在干嘛?
What did you do?

1262
01:23:47,188 --> 01:23:49,941
这个嘛 我打造了一个小镇
Well, I made the best of it. I built a town.

1263
01:23:50,567 --> 01:23:51,735
挺好玩的
And that was fun.

1264
01:23:53,570 --> 01:23:54,571
交了些朋友
Made some friends.

1265
01:23:56,531 --> 01:23:58,158
也失去了些朋友
Lost some friends.

1266
01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:02,704
让我下定决心寻找月亮之泪
That's when I decided to search for the Tears of the Moon.

1267
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:05,874
我造了一艘船
I built a boat.

1268
01:24:08,543 --> 01:24:11,796
以月亮女神之名命名为 "奎娜号"
And I named her after the goddess of the moon, Quila.

1269
01:24:13,006 --> 01:24:15,675
乘着它去遍每条支流和角落
I charted every inch of this river, searching.

1270
01:24:17,093 --> 01:24:18,136
直到我彻底放弃
Till I finally gave up.

1271
01:24:18,553 --> 01:24:20,472
因为我根本没办法离开河边半步
And since I could never leave sight of the river,

1272
01:24:20,638 --> 01:24:22,974
所以我开办丛林航游 噱一些观光客
I started giving jungle cruises to tourists.

1273
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:25,310
好孤独啊
All that time, all alone...

1274
01:24:25,393 --> 01:24:28,104
也不完全啦
Well, not entirely alone, of course.

1275
01:24:28,188 --> 01:24:29,189
没错
That's right.

1276
01:24:29,272 --> 01:24:32,317
我开始领养流浪动物
Over the years, I would find strays that needed someone.

1277
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:34,944
死了一只再换一只 换了又死 死了又换
The next, after the next, after the next.

1278
01:24:35,445 --> 01:24:37,238
小普西玛 老普西玛 阿祖普西玛...
And la proxima, la proxima...

1279
01:24:37,322 --> 01:24:38,656
普西玛?    -普西玛，对
La proxima? Proxima, yes,

1280
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:40,408
全都取名普西玛   -噢
I name 'em all Proxima. -Oh, la proxima.

1281
01:24:41,534 --> 01:24:43,453
喔 不过你是我最爱的普西玛
Oh, but don't worry, you're my favorite girl.

1282
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:47,624
时间就飞呀飞呀飞
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily

1283
01:24:47,707 --> 01:24:49,793
人生如诗
Life is but a dream

1284
01:24:50,668 --> 01:24:52,670
你应该要接下去第二段的
You're meant to join in on the second verse.

1285
01:24:52,837 --> 01:24:54,672
我再来一次喔
I'll do it again, shall I?

1286
01:24:55,757 --> 01:24:57,092
划 划 划
Row, row, row...

1287
01:24:57,175 --> 01:24:59,135
求你了 闭嘴
I'm begging you, stop!

1288
01:25:03,139 --> 01:25:04,390
到底到了没?
Are we there yet?

1289
01:25:04,474 --> 01:25:05,475
还没!
No!

1290
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:10,396
想到一个
Got one.

1291
01:25:10,563 --> 01:25:12,982
我的小眼找到了
I spy with my little eye

1292
01:25:13,149 --> 01:25:15,485
第一个字母是...
something beginning with...

1293
01:25:18,988 --> 01:25:20,406
"S."

1294
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:23,284
要不要搭便船？
Thought you might want a lift.

1295
01:25:24,577 --> 01:25:25,578
嘿!
Hey!

1296
01:25:25,662 --> 01:25:28,498
我不喜欢和陌生人共乘一船
I don't take lifts from strangers.

1297
01:25:28,748 --> 01:25:29,874
茶?
Cup of tea?

1298
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:36,965
那么，喜欢你的丛林吗?
So, how do you enjoy this jungle?

1299
01:25:37,298 --> 01:25:38,633
不好意思?
I beg your pardon?

1300
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:39,926
这个丛林
This jungle.

1301
01:25:40,218 --> 01:25:42,178
你说什么?   -丛林
Yeah, sorry? -The jungle.

1302
01:25:42,262 --> 01:25:43,263
慢慢地
Try it slower.

1303
01:25:43,346 --> 01:25:44,347
丛林
The jungle.

1304
01:25:44,430 --> 01:25:45,515
放在一个句子中
Could you pop it in a sentence?

1305
01:25:45,598 --> 01:25:48,935
有树 有虫 有丛林
The trees, the bugs... The... The jungle.

1306
01:25:49,018 --> 01:25:50,645
丛林?    -对 讲很多次了
The jungle?  -Yes. That is what I said.

1307
01:25:50,812 --> 01:25:52,397
好吧    -喜欢丛林吗?
Right. -How do you enjoy it?

1308
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:53,690
有点慢慢变喜欢
It's actually rather grown on me.

1309
01:25:53,857 --> 01:25:55,525
我他妈不在乎了
I don't care anymore.

1310
01:25:56,693 --> 01:25:58,736
长官，到达目的
Sir, we have arrived at the target.

1311
01:25:59,195 --> 01:26:01,906
阿，是时候来个交易了
Ah. Time to make a deal.

1312
01:26:04,367 --> 01:26:06,369
看那边
Look, right through here.

1313
01:26:07,787 --> 01:26:10,748
是不是有个和蔼的米丘纳小村
You see the peaceful Puka Michuna tribe?

1314
01:26:10,915 --> 01:26:14,377
我只要按下这个按钮
With the touch of this button here,

1315
01:26:14,544 --> 01:26:17,672
就能一次干掉400个人
I could end 400 innocent lives.

1316
01:26:17,839 --> 01:26:21,968
他们要怪就怪自己怎么还活着
Their only crime being that they are still living.

1317
01:26:22,135 --> 01:26:26,222
你也可以告诉我 你姐姐和圣镞在哪
Your sister and the Arrowhead were here. Now, I need to know where she is going.

1318
01:26:26,389 --> 01:26:27,557
选择权在你手上
The choice is yours.

1319
01:26:27,724 --> 01:26:31,019
要他们生 还是死
Do they live or do they die?

1320
01:26:34,564 --> 01:26:36,024
帮你吧   -不要，轮到我了
Let me help you. No, it's my turn.

1321
01:26:36,107 --> 01:26:38,526
好的 大人说的是
Okay. You gotta listen to her.

1322
01:26:38,610 --> 01:26:40,612
完美  -真不错
It's perfect. -Pretty good.

1323
01:26:40,778 --> 01:26:42,906
现在可以放它自己滑行了
Yeah. Now we can just cruise.

1324
01:26:49,662 --> 01:26:51,873
人们找了这东西好久了
Do you know how many years people have been looking for that?

1325
01:26:51,956 --> 01:26:53,583
这老东西?    -对，那老东西
This old thing?  -Yeah. That old thing.

1326
01:26:53,666 --> 01:26:55,126
你怎么拿到手的
How is it that you turn up with it?

1327
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:56,961
偷的
Stole it.

1328
01:26:57,045 --> 01:26:58,087
你偷的?
You stole it?

1329
01:26:59,130 --> 01:27:01,216
解放了它 这样怎么样
Liberated it. How about that?

1330
01:27:01,299 --> 01:27:02,300
好..
Okay.

1331
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:08,640
我已经找了很多年，现在是你的了
I've searched for this thing for so long, but I'm pretty sure it belongs to you.

1332
01:27:14,729 --> 01:27:16,731
找到神树的话你想做什么
What are you gonna do when you find the Tree?

1333
01:27:18,524 --> 01:27:19,984
解开诅咒
Lift the curse.

1334
01:27:20,568 --> 01:27:22,445
那你会发生什么事
And what will happen to you?

1335
01:27:22,737 --> 01:27:23,738
恩...
Well...

1336
01:27:25,907 --> 01:27:28,159
我得做出个选择
I get to make a choice.

1337
01:27:29,827 --> 01:27:31,829
选择安息
And I choose to rest.

1338
01:27:34,332 --> 01:27:35,375
嘿 莉莉 听我说
Hey, Lily, look.

1339
01:27:35,833 --> 01:27:39,045
这世界的一切对你来说都很新颖
Everything that you see that's new in this world,

1340
01:27:39,462 --> 01:27:42,382
对我来说却是老调常弹了
I've seen hundreds of thousands of times.

1341
01:27:43,883 --> 01:27:47,011
但没有一刻比现在更有意义
Yes, but none of it has been meaningful.

1342
01:27:53,559 --> 01:27:56,437
他们在哪?
All right. Where are they?

1343
01:27:58,731 --> 01:28:01,067
我认不太出...
I don't actually recognize the specific...

1344
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:02,277
哪里?    -这
Where?  -There.

1345
01:28:08,491 --> 01:28:09,492
你应该有打到
I think you got it.

1346
01:28:10,576 --> 01:28:12,787
神树是我的囊中之物
The Tree is here and will be ours.

1347
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:18,209
不能让蜜蜂的主人知道这个位置
I cannot share my discoveries with their masters.

1348
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,837
你在下面多久了?
You've been down here a while?

1349
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:41,316
这一定是那个"巨石之水"
This has got to be "water to stone."

1350
01:28:46,946 --> 01:28:48,656
爬上去怎么样?
Do you think that we climb?

1351
01:28:54,912 --> 01:28:56,664
我觉得不是往上
I don't think we're meant to go up.

1352
01:29:01,210 --> 01:29:02,378
运气不错
We're in luck.

1353
01:29:02,462 --> 01:29:04,255
下面石室里有一个拉杆
There's a chamber down there with a lever in it.

1354
01:29:04,339 --> 01:29:05,798
我觉得那是关键
I think pulling it is the key.

1355
01:29:05,882 --> 01:29:06,883
那很好啊!
That's wonderful!

1356
01:29:06,966 --> 01:29:08,301
超棒 完美
It's wonderful. It's fantastic.

1357
01:29:08,384 --> 01:29:11,888
有个问题是 我们的祖先
Only problem is that the ancients who built all of this

1358
01:29:12,055 --> 01:29:14,515
比较瘦一点
were on average narrower.

1359
01:29:16,059 --> 01:29:18,644
恩 恩    -所以换你上场啰
Mm-hmm. -So, it's a great time for you

1360
01:29:18,728 --> 01:29:20,521
终于能洗个好澡啰
to take the finest bath in all Brazil.

1361
01:29:20,605 --> 01:29:22,690
不不不 法兰克 拜托别  -要 裤子小姐 听着
No, no, no. Frank, Frank, please! -Yes. Pants, listen...

1362
01:29:22,774 --> 01:29:24,734
我不会游泳 我不会
I cannot swim, Frank. That is not something I can do.

1363
01:29:24,817 --> 01:29:25,818
你又没试过
You've never tried.

1364
01:29:25,902 --> 01:29:27,487
跟那无关 我打从心里怕水
It's not about trying. I have this very deep fear.

1365
01:29:27,570 --> 01:29:28,738
我负责游泳
I'll do all the swimming.

1366
01:29:28,821 --> 01:29:29,989
法兰克 拜托...   -听我说
Frank, please. -Listen... Look,

1367
01:29:30,073 --> 01:29:31,366
我不能没有你
I can't do this without you.

1368
01:29:31,741 --> 01:29:32,992
我需要你来完成
I need you.

1369
01:29:34,285 --> 01:29:35,787
相信我好吗
You have to trust me.

1370
01:29:37,914 --> 01:29:39,374
不，不要 法兰克 法兰克 法兰克 拜托
No, no. Frank, Frank, Frank, please.

1371
01:29:39,457 --> 01:29:40,792
我以为你...
I thought you might, uh...

1372
01:29:40,875 --> 01:29:42,627
转过去 眼睛盯着瀑布 老喘长
Just turn around and look at the waterfall, Skippy.

1373
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:45,088
好不好?  -好好好
All right? Please. -Fine. Whew.

1374
01:29:47,632 --> 01:29:48,800
不准偷看
Don't look.

1375
01:29:49,634 --> 01:29:51,844
你是裤子里面还有穿裤子?
Are you wearing pants under your pants?

1376
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:53,888
对  -天阿 法兰克!
Yes. -Oh, my God! Frank!

1377
01:29:53,971 --> 01:29:55,014
没事 没关系的
It's okay. It's okay.

1378
01:29:55,098 --> 01:29:56,182
准备好   -我还没...不 不!
Here we go. -I'm not... No, no!

1379
01:29:56,265 --> 01:29:58,267
等等! 有东西在碰我的脚 法兰克!
Wait a minute! Something just touched my foot, Frank!

1380
01:29:58,351 --> 01:30:00,645
没事，没事，那是我的脚趾头
It's okay, it's okay. It was my foot.

1381
01:30:00,728 --> 01:30:01,854
喔 我很抱歉
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1382
01:30:01,938 --> 01:30:03,314
我太害怕了   -别怕 我够稳
I'm very scared. -Okay. I got you.

1383
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:04,899
别怕 深呼吸
It's okay. Breathe.

1384
01:30:05,608 --> 01:30:07,110
准备?   -好
Ready? Okay. -Yes.

1385
01:32:35,007 --> 01:32:36,008
莉莉!
Lily!

1386
01:32:37,093 --> 01:32:38,302
莉莉! 醒醒 醒醒
Lily, come on, come on.

1387
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:39,762
醒醒 莉莉 醒醒
Come on. Lily, come on.

1388
01:32:39,845 --> 01:32:41,764
别这样 莉莉
Come on. Come on, Lily.

1389
01:32:43,432 --> 01:32:45,518
你在搞什么 法兰克
What is the matter with you, Frank?

1390
01:32:45,601 --> 01:32:46,852
你醒来了  -怎么可以丢下我一个人
You're alive! -How could you leave me?

1391
01:32:46,936 --> 01:32:49,063
我没有丢下你一个人 是因为好多鱼...
I didn't leave you. There was a lot of fish down there that...

1392
01:32:49,146 --> 01:32:50,731
鱼?什么鬼 法兰克
What? Fish? Frank...

1393
01:32:50,898 --> 01:32:52,191
很多食人鱼正朝我们冲过来
There were lot of piranha, they were coming after...

1394
01:32:52,275 --> 01:32:54,527
我为了救你，看我的衣服...   -不准看我
I saved you. Look.  -Don't even look at me.

1395
01:32:54,694 --> 01:32:55,778
好
Fine.

1396
01:33:13,754 --> 01:33:15,881
"化水为石"
"Turn water to stone..."

1397
01:33:19,427 --> 01:33:21,387
过了400年...
After 400 years...

1398
01:33:21,929 --> 01:33:23,431
我找到了
I found it.

1399
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:25,641
我们找到了!
We found it!

1400
01:33:31,355 --> 01:33:32,648
你现在是花界达尔文了
Now you can be the Darwin of flowers.

1401
01:33:32,815 --> 01:33:35,735
花瓣在那 你自由了 你可以..
The petal's right there, you can be free. You can...

1402
01:33:35,818 --> 01:33:37,445
我意思是 河流很美
I mean, it's not like the river's not beautiful,

1403
01:33:37,528 --> 01:33:38,779
但你可以去更美的地方了
but you can go anywhere

1404
01:33:38,863 --> 01:33:41,365
环游世界 来伦敦
and you can see the world. You can come to London.

1405
01:33:41,449 --> 01:33:43,284
我住伦敦 可以带你参观
I'm from London. I could show it to you.

1406
01:33:43,367 --> 01:33:45,620
我有车子 我可以当你的船长
I even have a motor car. I could be like your skipper,

1407
01:33:45,703 --> 01:33:47,955
喘长...如果你喜欢的话
Skippy... If you want.

1408
01:33:48,372 --> 01:33:50,791
莉莉 我很喜欢和你在一起
Lily, I would love to do all that with you.

1409
01:33:51,334 --> 01:33:52,960
但我已经下定决心了
But I've made up my mind.

1410
01:33:53,628 --> 01:33:56,213
我没办法去伦敦
There is no London for me after this.

1411
01:33:58,174 --> 01:33:59,717
也没有汽车等着我
There's no motor car.

1412
01:34:06,515 --> 01:34:07,683
我已经准备好了
I'm ready.

1413
01:34:08,059 --> 01:34:09,060
不
No.

1414
01:34:09,143 --> 01:34:12,730
我的时候到了，该面对的总该是要面对的
It's my time. It was my time long ago.

1415
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:22,865
不要 我不同意 你可以有新的人生的
No. No, I don't accept it. You could have one more life.

1416
01:34:22,948 --> 01:34:24,116
还好有选择权的人是我
Luckily for me, it's my choice.

1417
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:27,912
有什么好开心的 你总是做出错误的决定
Well, it shouldn't be, because you have very poor judgement.

1418
01:34:28,079 --> 01:34:30,956
你还有大好人生在等着，那是你的世界
But you have your world to go back to. It's your world.

1419
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:33,459
那也可以是你的世界啊
But it could be yours, too.

1420
01:34:37,338 --> 01:34:40,257
也许你的世界有某个人足矣
It could be that one person's world enough.

1421
01:34:53,979 --> 01:34:55,272
也许吧
Could be.

1422
01:34:59,276 --> 01:35:01,195
莉莉...
Lily...

1423
01:35:04,407 --> 01:35:05,408
莉莉
Lily.

1424
01:35:15,209 --> 01:35:16,210
哈啰
Hello.

1425
01:35:16,752 --> 01:35:20,131
我绝不会透露任何消息给一个用加农炮对着我的人
Small chance I told a madman with a cannon where to find you.

1426
01:35:30,641 --> 01:35:32,601
终于见面了
Oh, so, we finally meet.

1427
01:35:34,979 --> 01:35:38,065
哇 又大又壮的男孩 哈
Wow. Big, strong boy, huh?

1428
01:35:40,276 --> 01:35:43,571
去驾驶室 马上
Go to the bridge. Go.

1429
01:35:48,868 --> 01:35:52,872
这是你的吧?
I believe this belongs to you.

1430
01:35:55,541 --> 01:35:58,711
圣镞呢?
Now, the Arrowhead, please?

1431
01:36:01,046 --> 01:36:02,047
不 不 不
No, no, no.

1432
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:12,183
真是一位想像力丰富的女人
Such an imaginative woman

1433
01:36:12,349 --> 01:36:15,770
死命寻找月亮之泪然后无私分享给科学界
seeking the Tears of the Moon to share with the scientific community

1434
01:36:15,853 --> 01:36:20,191
他们根本就不会给你一席之地
that won't even permit you, Fraulein, to sit among them.

1435
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:23,944
把这种强大的力量
To put that tremendous power

1436
01:36:24,111 --> 01:36:27,490
交给一群乌合之众太浪费
into the hands of the masses would be pure madness.

1437
01:36:27,656 --> 01:36:31,494
交给我，不但可以帮德国打胜仗
When I could use the Tears, not only to win the war,

1438
01:36:31,660 --> 01:36:35,790
还能统治世世代代
but to reign for all generations to come.

1439
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:37,625
带走
Take them away.

1440
01:36:42,546 --> 01:36:46,425
启动，朝向神树
Eyes ahead. Navigate to the Tree.

1441
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:47,570
这棵树已经死了
This Tree is long dead.

1442
01:37:47,736 --> 01:37:51,365
你比谁都了解神树，所以..
You know more about the Tears of the Moon than anyone, so...

1443
01:37:52,032 --> 01:37:55,244
你会知道如何让树开花的，交给你了
you know how to make it bloom. You will do this for me.

1444
01:37:55,411 --> 01:37:56,829
你获得你想要的东西后
And when you have what you want,

1445
01:37:57,162 --> 01:37:59,248
也没理由让我们活着了吧
what's to stop you from killing us then?

1446
01:37:59,623 --> 01:38:01,417
我也可以现在就杀了你
I could kill you now.

1447
01:38:02,918 --> 01:38:03,961
我来
I'll do it.

1448
01:38:04,128 --> 01:38:07,590
但你要保证放他们离开，并留给我一片花瓣
If you promise to let them go and give me one single petal in return.

1449
01:38:07,756 --> 01:38:11,051
我对传说的所有细节了若指掌
I know the myths and the ancient ways as if I've lived them myself.

1450
01:38:11,218 --> 01:38:12,219
法兰克 别这样...
Frank, do not...

1451
01:38:12,303 --> 01:38:15,222
如果这里有谁能够拿到月亮之泪，那一定是我
If anyone here is going to bring the Tears of the Moon, it's me.

1452
01:38:17,558 --> 01:38:21,604
你让树开花，就给你花瓣
If you can make the Tree bloom, you may have your petal.

1453
01:38:21,687 --> 01:38:22,938
我保证
You have my word.

1454
01:38:25,733 --> 01:38:26,901
没别的办法了
There's no other way.

1455
01:38:27,067 --> 01:38:29,069
但小弟弟得留下
But the little brother stays on the boat.

1456
01:38:29,236 --> 01:38:31,155
小弟弟? 我有名字的
Little brother? I have a name.

1457
01:38:56,013 --> 01:38:57,556
去吧
Go ahead.

1458
01:39:12,363 --> 01:39:14,073
应该摆这吧
The Arrowhead should fit here.

1459
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:17,660
去帮他一下   -不要
You better go help him. Go. -No.

1460
01:39:18,285 --> 01:39:19,703
不要?
No?

1461
01:39:23,499 --> 01:39:25,250
你也得给我一片花瓣
I'll do it if you give me a petal as well.

1462
01:39:26,418 --> 01:39:29,588
如果我也给你...
If I give you a petal as well...

1463
01:39:29,755 --> 01:39:32,466
只能留下一片，你们自己选
One petal. Not two. You must choose.

1464
01:39:32,633 --> 01:39:35,094
大只佬 你怎么想
What do you think, Muscles?

1465
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:39,682
你愿意牺牲自己的花瓣给她?
Will you sacrifice your petal for her?

1466
01:39:41,767 --> 01:39:43,227
那她得先踏过我的尸体
She'd have to kill me first.

1467
01:39:51,276 --> 01:39:52,903
看着办   -没事啦
Done.  -Done.

1468
01:40:00,869 --> 01:40:02,496
"伤心的战士......"
"Broken-hearted warrior"

1469
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:05,207
"爬上最高的山"
"climbed to the highest peak"

1470
01:40:05,374 --> 01:40:07,793
"向月亮射出他的箭"
"and shot his arrow into the Moon."

1471
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:11,338
"月亮见他痛苦，也落下眼泪"
"From there, the Moon learned real pain and began to weep."

1472
01:40:11,505 --> 01:40:14,466
"眼泪落下之处一棵神圣的树发芽了"
"Where the Tears fell grew a sacred Tree..."

1473
01:40:19,054 --> 01:40:21,557
Rum-pum-pum-pum...

1474
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:26,729
给我镞头
Give me the Arrow.

1475
01:40:32,985 --> 01:40:33,986
动作快!
Hurry up!

1476
01:40:42,494 --> 01:40:45,497
山姆说我必须修复破碎的心
Trader Sam said we would need to fix a broken heart.

1477
01:40:45,664 --> 01:40:48,542
这不是箭镞 而是一颗心
It's not an Arrowhead, it's a heart.

1478
01:40:49,084 --> 01:40:50,836
你无法修补一颗
You can't mend a heart that isn't...

1479
01:40:50,919 --> 01:40:52,337
没有破碎的心
...broken.

1480
01:42:37,818 --> 01:42:39,278
花瓣是我的了
I'll take that petal now.

1481
01:43:00,215 --> 01:43:01,884
"在哭泣的月亮下"
"Under the crying Moon..."

1482
01:43:02,593 --> 01:43:06,013
得在凋谢前赶紧采摘，快点儿!
We must pluck the petals before it sets. Go! Hurry!

1483
01:43:31,079 --> 01:43:32,080
又来
Every time.

1484
01:43:32,206 --> 01:43:33,207
抱歉
Sorry.

1485
01:43:47,304 --> 01:43:48,847
开枪!
Shoot!

1486
01:43:54,144 --> 01:43:55,854
干的好 杀人小猫咪
Good murder cat.

1487
01:43:59,107 --> 01:44:00,234
莉莉呢?
Where's Lily?

1488
01:44:00,943 --> 01:44:01,944
上面
Up there.

1489
01:44:02,861 --> 01:44:04,780
又来了
Here we go again.

1490
01:44:10,786 --> 01:44:11,995
月亮躲起来了
The Moon's setting.

1491
01:44:12,162 --> 01:44:13,205
树也开始凋零
The Tree is dying.

1492
01:44:23,674 --> 01:44:24,716
哇
Whoa.

1493
01:44:34,393 --> 01:44:35,394
加油
Come on.

1494
01:44:40,315 --> 01:44:41,316
太好了
Yes!

1495
01:44:47,322 --> 01:44:49,032
莉莉!
Lily!

1496
01:44:59,501 --> 01:45:04,756
这情况似曾相似呢?
This is a amusingly familiar situation, no?

1497
01:45:06,216 --> 01:45:08,401
给我花瓣
Give me that petal.

1498
01:45:08,710 --> 01:45:11,387
不   -你迟早要死
No. -You are about to die one way or another,

1499
01:45:11,554 --> 01:45:14,474
但是不交给我
but if you do not give me that petal,

1500
01:45:14,641 --> 01:45:16,184
你弟可就不一定能活着了
so, too, will your brother.

1501
01:45:16,810 --> 01:45:20,897
我会让他慢慢被折磨到死
His will be much more slower.

1502
01:45:22,316 --> 01:45:23,817
给我花瓣!
Give me that petal.

1503
01:45:33,493 --> 01:45:36,330
一片就好 给我!
Just one is enough. Give it to me.

1504
01:45:40,792 --> 01:45:42,669
死都不要，法兰克!
Never. Frank!

1505
01:45:42,919 --> 01:45:43,920
放开我!
Let go of me!

1506
01:45:48,925 --> 01:45:50,344
掌好舵
Take the wheel. Hold her steady.

1507
01:46:13,075 --> 01:46:14,743
你是我养过最棒的猫咪
You're the best cat I've ever had.

1508
01:46:19,581 --> 01:46:20,749
滚开
Get off!

1509
01:46:23,543 --> 01:46:25,754
看来你对我的小蜜蜂们
It looks like you haven't been very nice...

1510
01:46:25,921 --> 01:46:27,881
不太友善
to my little friends.

1511
01:46:28,048 --> 01:46:30,008
阿吉雷 去抢花瓣
Aguirre, help me to get the petal!

1512
01:46:30,092 --> 01:46:33,470
拿到花瓣，我给你一切，钱，船
I'll give you anything you want! Money, ships...

1513
01:46:33,845 --> 01:46:34,971
整个西班牙王国!
Spain!

1514
01:46:35,180 --> 01:46:37,265
皇室不值得信任
Royalty is not to be trusted.

1515
01:46:43,313 --> 01:46:45,023
阿吉雷，那个穿长裤的女人...
Aguirre, the woman in pants...

1516
01:46:47,651 --> 01:46:48,902
拦住她!
Get her!

1517
01:46:55,659 --> 01:46:56,910
阿吉雷!
Aguirre!

1518
01:46:59,246 --> 01:47:00,414
法兰西斯科拿到花瓣了
Francisco has the petal!

1519
01:47:03,250 --> 01:47:04,292
阻止他!
Stop him!

1520
01:47:10,882 --> 01:47:12,592
你的终点站到了  -什么?
This is where you get off. -What?

1521
01:47:13,677 --> 01:47:15,720
告诉莉莉，她就是我的全世界
Tell Lily she would've been world enough for me.

1522
01:47:15,804 --> 01:47:16,805
你要去哪?
Where are you going?

1523
01:47:16,888 --> 01:47:20,684
普西玛，保护好他，你是自己的主人了 去吧
Proxima. You protect him, you're in charge. Go.

1524
01:47:22,060 --> 01:47:23,937
再见 小猫
Goodbye, girl.

1525
01:47:37,451 --> 01:47:40,454
让我们进行最后一次航行吧
Let's give 'em one last cruise, mi buena nina.

1526
01:47:41,121 --> 01:47:42,497
只有一个方法能结束这一切
There's only one way to end this.

1527
01:47:42,664 --> 01:47:43,874
来抓我!
Come and get me.

1528
01:47:48,503 --> 01:47:50,297
莉莉
Lily.

1529
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:13,612
他要撞墙了
He's going to crash.

1530
01:48:15,655 --> 01:48:17,491
不，他是想堵住河水
No, he's gonna block the river.

1531
01:48:43,058 --> 01:48:44,059
法兰西斯科!
Francisco!

1532
01:48:44,726 --> 01:48:45,977
花瓣给我!
Give me the petal!

1533
01:48:46,061 --> 01:48:47,729
在他口袋!
He has the petal in his pocket!

1534
01:48:49,105 --> 01:48:50,607
我受够了
Enough is enough!

1535
01:48:50,982 --> 01:48:53,276
我要杀了你们两个!
It's now time for you to die!

1536
01:48:53,735 --> 01:48:54,778
好
Right.

1537
01:48:54,861 --> 01:48:56,780
我想我们已经受够了你
I think we've had quite enough of you.

1538
01:49:01,910 --> 01:49:03,495
晚安
Good night.

1539
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:15,507
我不是故意的...
Not exactly what I intended.

1540
01:49:27,852 --> 01:49:30,730
兄弟之情伤人最深
A brother's blade cuts deepest.

1541
01:49:38,613 --> 01:49:40,782
给我花瓣
Give me the petal.

1542
01:49:40,949 --> 01:49:42,325
他告诉我要告诉你
He told me to tell you,

1543
01:49:42,409 --> 01:49:44,369
你就是他的全世界
you would have been world enough for him.

1544
01:49:45,495 --> 01:49:46,955
花瓣在哪?
Where's the petal?

1545
01:49:54,212 --> 01:49:55,547
抱歉了 老朋友
I'm sorry, old friend.

1546
01:49:56,089 --> 01:49:57,674
他把这个留给了你
He wanted you to have it.

1547
01:49:59,718 --> 01:50:01,636
拦下船!  拦下他!!
Stop the boat! Stop it!

1548
01:50:01,803 --> 01:50:03,305
法兰克  -等等
Frank. -Wait.

1549
01:50:04,848 --> 01:50:06,308
法兰克，不要!
Frank, no!

1550
01:50:06,474 --> 01:50:08,602
不可以!
No!

1551
01:50:43,762 --> 01:50:45,055
法兰西斯科，你做了什么?
Francisco, what have you done?

1552
01:50:45,555 --> 01:50:47,724
你把我折磨得比死还难受
This is worse than death! This is torture!

1553
01:51:30,475 --> 01:51:35,063
你真的让我又气又痛
Oh, you are the most infuriating man I've ever met.

1554
01:51:45,615 --> 01:51:46,991
莉莉
Lily...

1555
01:53:13,453 --> 01:53:14,454
法兰克
Frank.

1556
01:53:32,514 --> 01:53:33,515
法兰克!
Frank!

1557
01:53:43,274 --> 01:53:44,359
你在流血
Oh, you're bleeding.

1558
01:53:44,442 --> 01:53:45,735
好痛
That hurts.

1559
01:53:45,819 --> 01:53:46,903
会痛?    -对
It does? -Yeah.

1560
01:53:46,986 --> 01:53:47,987
那很好阿
Well, that's good.

1561
01:53:48,655 --> 01:53:49,823
你竟然真的对我开枪
I can't believe you shot me.

1562
01:53:49,906 --> 01:53:51,407
厉害吧   -还打两发?
I know.   -Twice.

1563
01:53:51,574 --> 01:53:52,951
我知道 但是你中了一枪不倒下
I know, but you didn't go down the first time.

1564
01:53:53,034 --> 01:53:54,661
你应该倒下的
You should've just gone down.

1565
01:54:03,002 --> 01:54:04,921
你们真是我的全世界
You're both my world.

1566
01:54:38,830 --> 01:54:40,123
哇 哇 哇
Well, well, well...

1567
01:54:40,206 --> 01:54:41,541
尼罗，整艘都是你的了
Nilo. Now you have all the boats.

1568
01:54:41,624 --> 01:54:43,751
好好照顾她
Take care of her.

1569
01:54:48,756 --> 01:54:51,968
我曾在同一个讲台上说起月亮之泪
I stand before you today to tell you about the Tears of the Moon.

1570
01:54:52,176 --> 01:54:53,469
这个传说是真的
The legend is true.

1571
01:54:55,096 --> 01:54:59,809
我们比其他任何人都更深入地进入亚马逊
Our party traveled further into the Amazon than any expedition had previously dared.

1572
01:55:01,603 --> 01:55:04,731
在这场旅程中，生死变得模糊
On our trip, the lines between life and death,

1573
01:55:04,814 --> 01:55:06,691
过去与现在之间的界限消失了
past and present, vanished.

1574
01:55:07,901 --> 01:55:10,236
我亲眼见证了传说化为现实
I witnessed things not to be believed.

1575
01:55:10,653 --> 01:55:13,948
见证可以迷惑心智的妖河豚
Enchanted dolphins that could haunt one's dreams.

1576
01:55:14,282 --> 01:55:15,867
见证丛林的囚犯
Undead conquistadors,

1577
01:55:15,950 --> 01:55:19,370
被诅咒的征服者
cursed as prisoners of the jungle for nearly 400 years.

1578
01:55:20,038 --> 01:55:22,081
一个部落酋长，一位女士
A tribe whose chief, a lady...

1579
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,836
别嘘，他们运作的挺好的
No! It actually worked rather well.

1580
01:55:27,462 --> 01:55:29,839
重点是，这是一个
My point is, this was a journey

1581
01:55:29,923 --> 01:55:32,467
整个科学界从未体验过的旅程
the likes of which this society has never seen.

1582
01:55:32,884 --> 01:55:35,929
一次无愧这个冒险协会的冒险
An adventure truly worthy of this association.

1583
01:55:36,846 --> 01:55:41,017
但这协会值得我们这样冒险吗?
But is this association worthy of our great adventure?

1584
01:55:41,559 --> 01:55:44,270
其实，我们也不用去找月亮之泪
You see, we didn't seek the Tears of the Moon

1585
01:55:44,354 --> 01:55:46,481
随便用一堆屁话充篇幅
so that we could be written up in some journal

1586
01:55:46,564 --> 01:55:48,232
就能交出一篇期刊变会员啊
for a load of crusty old farts.

1587
01:55:49,943 --> 01:55:53,237
我的姐姐，现在是剑桥大学的教授
My sister, who just made full professor at Cambridge,

1588
01:55:53,404 --> 01:55:55,657
麻烦我，有礼貌地
has asked me to respectfully reject

1589
01:55:55,740 --> 01:55:58,201
帮她拒绝你们协会的会员邀请
your invitation of membership on her behalf.

1590
01:55:58,368 --> 01:56:01,037
拒绝没问题啊，但是我不会有礼貌
Which I will do. Just not respectfully.

1591
01:56:01,204 --> 01:56:03,957
先生们 请把邀请函
Gentlemen, you can take your invitation

1592
01:56:04,499 --> 01:56:07,335
塞进自己的屁股里
and you can shove it up your association.

1593
01:56:09,796 --> 01:56:11,506
小子岂敢!
How dare you!

1594
01:56:17,512 --> 01:56:19,639
准备好上课了吗?
Ready for your first driving lesson?

1595
01:56:20,181 --> 01:56:21,766
应该吧 裤子女士
I think so, Pants.

1596
01:56:23,184 --> 01:56:26,562
希望你明白等下要面对什么
I hope you know what you're getting yourself into here, Frank.

1597
01:56:26,729 --> 01:56:27,730
面对方向盘
A car.

1598
01:56:27,814 --> 01:56:29,107
喔 你的笑点
Oh, your jokes.

1599
01:56:29,190 --> 01:56:31,150
总有一天会要我命
They will be the death of me.

1600
01:56:31,234 --> 01:56:33,778
简直跟放屁..折磨人一样
They are absolutely exhausting.

1601
01:56:36,114 --> 01:56:37,323
哇 莉莉
Wow, Lily.

1602
01:56:37,490 --> 01:56:39,534
你喜欢?   -这好笑
Did you like it? -It was good.

1603
01:56:39,617 --> 01:56:40,702
没错   -有没有骄傲?
Yeah. -Are you proud?

1604
01:56:40,785 --> 01:56:42,203
噢 法兰克 法兰克 法兰克!
Oh! Frank, Frank, Frank!

1605
01:56:42,286 --> 01:56:43,746
喔我的天阿   -好 我会了
Oh, my goodness! -Okay, I got it.

1606
01:56:43,830 --> 01:56:45,081
法兰克 夭寿哦
Frank, for goodness' sake!

1607
01:56:45,164 --> 01:56:47,083
我会了 我会了    -转弯! 转弯! 马上转弯!!
I got it, I got it. Turn now! Turn now! Turn now!

1608
01:56:47,166 --> 01:56:49,502
安啦 裤子小姐
I got it all under control, Pants.
